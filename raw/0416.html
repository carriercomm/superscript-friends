<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are
there. Phoebe is stressing out about something.]</p>

<p>Monica: What is it hon?</p>

<p>Phoebe: I-I can&#146;t find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes
me nauseous! I&#146;m telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake&#151;ooh! Cake!
(Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No.</p>

<p>Monica: Aww, honey I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p>Phoebe: God! Ooh! What is that smell? It&#146;s coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
(She goes to the bathroom.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.</p>

<p>[Cut to the bathroom, Joey is taking a shower and Phoebe knocks on the door.]</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah?</p>

<p>Phoebe: It&#146;s me. It&#146;s Phoebe. Listen there&#146;s something in here I
want to eat, what-what smells so good?</p>

<p>(Joey sticks his head out of the shower curtain.)</p>

<p>Joey: Is it the shampoo? It&#146;s guava.</p>

<p>Phoebe: (she smells his head) No!</p>

<p>Joey: Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yes. Yes. Yes. I can&#146;t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he
wants me to eat meat? I can&#146;t eat meat!</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe it&#146;s a pickle?!</p>

<p>(Phoebe grimaces at the smell.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, Joey and Rachel are there. Rachel is writing
something on a pad, and then crumples it up and throws it on the floor.]</p>

<p>Chandler: What are you writing?</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, Joshua&#146;s coming in tomorrow and since I don&#146;t have the
guts to ask him out, I&#146;m going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a
call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of style&#151;what did you throw away?</p>

<p>(Ross and Emily enter.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Hi guys!</p>

<p>All: Hey!</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, what have you guys been up too?</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the
Cupert-Hewitt museum.</p>

<p>Chandler: Without me?!</p>

<p>Emily: My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really
interesting.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah.</p>

<p>Emily: They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that! (Shows them a
doorknob she has.)</p>

<p>Monica: I don&#146;t know how museums work in England but, here, you&#146;re not
supposed to take stuff.</p>

<p>Emily: I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there.
(Chandler is shocked.) It&#146;s a joke. (They all laugh.)</p>

<p>Ross: Bye. (They kiss.)</p>

<p>Emily: Right, I&#146;ve got to be off, I&#146;ll see ya. Buh-bye then. (She
leaves.)</p>

<p>Joey: Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh yeah, she&#146;s-she&#146;s amazing. And-and she&#146;s so much fun.
And! Y&#146;know what? When I&#146;m with her, I&#146;m fun! I even signed up for
helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) She&#146;s leaving in two days, I don&#146;t
have to do it.</p>

<p>Monica: Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, she&#146;s got to go back to London. But you know what? I&#146;ve
been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and
that&#146;s it. Y&#146;know.</p>

<p>Joey: Hey that&#146;s what all my relationships are like.</p>

<p>Chandler: Yes, but in Ross&#146;s case, they both know in two weeks
that&#146;s it.</p>

<p>(Phoebe enters.)</p>

<p>Ross: Pheebs!</p>

<p>All: Hey!</p>

<p>Ross: (starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!</p>

<p>Phoebe: (angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is
totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make
it think it was getting meat, y&#146;know? And I got nauseous.</p>

<p>Chandler: Maybe that&#146;s because soy-burgers suck!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.</p>

<p>Phoebe: That&#146;s sweat. You throw up all morning, you&#146;ll have that glow
too.</p>

<p>[Scene: <i>Bloomingdale&#146;s</i>, Rachel is preparing to slip Joshua the note.]</p>

<p>Joshua: (coming in from a changing room) Okay!</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, here&#146;s that trench-coat that you wanted.</p>

<p>Joshua: Oh great! (He tries on the coat.) Wow! Yeah, it&#146;s comfortable. </p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah?</p>

<p>Joshua: Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing. (He goes to put his
hands in his pockets.)</p>

<p>Rachel: (stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they don&#146;t want you to put your
hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.</p>

<p>Joshua: Why not?!</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, that&#146;s because of a lot of&#133;(She imitates someone picking
their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)</p>

<p>Joshua: Y&#146;know, they ruin it for everybody.</p>

<p>Rachel: I know!</p>

<p>Joshua: Y&#146;know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh?</p>

<p>Joshua: Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, congratulations, so do you love her?</p>

<p>Joshua: No, no, no, she&#146;s nice but, y&#146;know, it just it made me realize
that I&#146;m just not, I&#146;m just not ready to be dating, y&#146;know?</p>

<p>Rachel: Huh. Well, uh, that&#146;s uh, that&#146;s interesting. (She goes over
and retrieves her note.)</p>

<p>Joshua: (noticing her) Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, it&#146;s just an anti-theft device.</p>

<p>Joshua: Then uh, what&#146;s-what&#146;s this? (Shows her the real anti-theft
device.)</p>

<p>Rachel: You need that, you need that too &#145;cause obviously, a thief could
just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross is writing on the <i>Magna-Doodle</i>
as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p>Rachel: Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we
have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.</p>

<p>Chandler: What are you talking about?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, what&#146; going on?</p>

<p>Rachel: We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it&#146;s
actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said he&#146;s not ready to
date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I
have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)</p>

<p>Ross: Well, as much as I&#146;d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I
aren&#146;t going to be here. All right? I mean, she&#146;s going to come by first to say
good-bye, and then I&#146;ve got a whole special evening planned. So I&#146;m sorry, no
party.</p>

<p>Joey: Awwww!</p>

<p>Emily: (entering) Hello?</p>

<p>Rachel: Surprise!!!</p>


<p>Chandler and Joey: Surprise!! </p>

<p>Emily: No one&#146;s ever thrown me a surprise party before!</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, it was all Ross&#146;s idea.</p>

<p>Emily: You&#146;re so sweet! And I&#146;m so surprised!</p>

<p>Ross: You really didn&#146;t know?</p>

<p>[Cut to later, the party is in full swing. Rachel is in the kitchen and Chandler goes
over to talk to her.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to
the living room.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Uhh, because I&#146;m trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he&#146;s
looking over here, say something funny.</p>

<p>Chandler: Like what?</p>

<p>(Rachel laughs hysterically.)</p>

<p>Joey: What-what-what is so funny?</p>

<p>Chandler: I said, &quot;Like what?&quot;</p>

<p>Joey: Now that&#146;s a thinker.</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay, y&#146;know what, y&#146;know what? This playing hard to get thing
is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She
does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!</p>

<p>Joshua: Hi!</p>

<p>Rachel: Care for a cherry?</p>

<p>Joshua: Oh, no thanks.</p>

<p>Rachel: No? Y&#146;know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my
tongue. </p>

<p>(She tries to demonstrate this unique ability, but only succeeds in choking on it.)</p>

<p>Joshua: You okay? (Rachel swallowed it whole and is not hacking like a heavy
smoker in the morning.) You all right? (Rachel walks away, coughing.)</p>

<p>Ross: (interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.</p>

<p>Emily: Oh, but the party&#146;s only just getting started!</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, but we-we have to be at the<i> Four Seasons</i> for drinks in 15
minutes and then y&#146;know, then <i>The Plaza</i> for dinner.</p>

<p>Emily: So why did you plan a party at the same time?</p>

<p>Ross: No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very
short. It&#146;s usually, &quot;Surprise!&quot; And then, &quot;Oh my God, I&#146;m so
surprised&#151;good-bye!&quot;</p>

<p>Emily: But Ross, I&#146;m such having a great time! Your sister has just been
telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea
parties.</p>

<p>Ross: Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monica&#146;s knee really hardly
and Monica winces in pain.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Joey and Phoebe in the kitchen. Phoebe is watching Joey make a sandwich.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?</p>

<p>Joey: A little salami. </p>

<p>Phoebe: Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?</p>

<p>Joey: Pastrami. </p>

<p>Phoebe: Oooh, yeah. You&#146;re a genius.</p>

<p>(Rachel enters, she has changed clothes.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah. (He goes over to her.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Up!</p>

<p>Monica: You changed?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.</p>

<p>Monica: And lucky means, more cleavage? </p>

<p>Chandler: Does for me.</p>

<p>(Joey starts wiping lint off of her back, but goes at little too far and Rachel just
glares at him. He stops, gives her the &#145;okay&#146; symbol and walks away.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Ohh, God! Look at him, he&#146;s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab
him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?</p>

<p>Joey: Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.</p>

<p>Rachel: What?</p>

<p>Joey: There was a seen in <i>Footloose</i>...</p>

<p>Chandler: <i>Flashdance</i>.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl&#133;</p>

<p>Chandler: She was a welder.</p>

<p>Joey: What? Were you like in the movie, or&#133; Anyway, she takes off
her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.</p>

<p>Monica: Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.</p>

<p>Rachel: It&#146;s not Christmas!</p>

<p>Monica: Or Spin the Bottle?</p>

<p>Rachel: He&#146;s not 11!</p>

<p>Emily: (with her coat on, she&#146;s leaving with Ross) Thank you so much for
this. It was really so thoughtful of you.</p>

<p>Rachel: What? You&#146;re leaving?!</p>

<p>Ross: Yes, we have something we have to get to.</p>

<p>Joshua: Uhh, yeah, I think I&#146;m going to take-off too.</p>

<p>Rachel: No! You guys can&#146;t leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole
big thing planned!</p>

<p>Ross: What big thing?</p>

<p>[Cut to later, the whole group is seated on the floor and Rachel is explaining the
rules of Spin the Bottle.]</p>

<p>Rachel: (spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the
bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where
Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Gunther&#146;s face and decides
not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?</p>

<p>Emily: I&#146;ll go.</p>

<p>All: Yay!</p>

<p>(Emily spins the bottle and it lands on Joey.)</p>

<p>Joey: Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)</p>

<p>(Joey spins the bottle and it lands on Emily.)</p>

<p>Monica: Two in a row! You&#146;ve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss
again.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Yay! Emily! </p>

<p>(Emily spins the bottle and once again, it lands on Joey.)</p>

<p>Chandler: What are the odds? What are the odds?</p>

<p>(They both move to kiss again.)</p>

<p>Ross: (stopping them) Okay, that-that&#146;s enough! Y&#146;know, let&#146;s,
let&#146;s let someone else play.</p>

<p>Joey: If you didn&#146;t want to play, why did you come to the party?</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay, my turn!!</p>

<p>(Rachel spins the bottle and it lands on&#133;.wait for it&#133;.Joshua. (You thought I
was going to say Ross, didn&#146;t you?) Rachel squeals in delight and starts a slow sexy
crawl over to Joshua, making sure he and everyone else watching gets a good look at her
cleavage.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!</p>

<p>All: Ohh!</p>

<p>Rachel: It&#146;s okay! It&#146;s okay! It kicked once, it&#146;ll kick again!</p>

<p>All: Oh my God!</p>

<p>(They all stand up and go over to Phoebe to feel the baby, preventing Rachel from
kissing Joshua.)</p>

<p>Rachel: All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting. </p>

<p>(She crawls over to Joshua and kisses the back of his knee. He feels it and looks down,
Rachel pretends she&#146;s knocking a bug off his leg.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Just a bug.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, it is later in the party. The
Spin the Bottle game is over and Chandler is making a sandwich as Phoebe watches.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Y&#146;know it doesn&#146;t matter how much I&#146;m craving it.
Y&#146;know why I&#146;m never gonna eat meat? Because it&#146;s murder, cold blooded
murder.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay. </p>

<p>(He takes a bite out of the sandwich and as he does so, Phoebe attacks the other end
and starts devouring the sandwich.)</p>

<p>Chandler: There&#146;s a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the
sandwich to Phoebe.)</p>

<p>Joey: Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!</p>

<p>Phoebe: I can&#146;t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.</p>

<p>Joey: All right look, y&#146;know how-y&#146;know how when you&#146;re dating
someone and you don&#146;t want to cheat on them, unless it&#146;s with someone really
hot?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, totally!</p>

<p>Joey: All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you&#146;re going
to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!</p>

<p>[Cut to later, Phoebe is finishing off her steak.]</p>

<p>Joey: Feel better now?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I&#146;m
gonna eat like, y&#146;know millions of cows.</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.</p>

<p>Phoebe: What?</p>

<p>Joey: Well, I eat a lot of meat right?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah.</p>

<p>Joey: Well, suppose until the baby&#146;s born I laid off it. No extra animals
would die, you-you&#146;d just be eating my animals.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Joey, I can&#146;t believe you would do that for me.</p>

<p>Joey: Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There&#146;s no meat in beer, right?</p>

<p>[Cut to Ross and Emily standing by the foosball table.]</p>

<p>Ross: Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked
for our check right away.</p>

<p>(Rachel enters, she has changed once again. This time into her high school cheerleading
uniform.)</p>

<p>Emily: But, we can&#146;t go now. It looks like Rachel&#146;s gonna put on a
skit.</p>

<p>Monica: Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?</p>

<p>Rachel: No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress
wasn&#146;t working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.</p>

<p>Monica: Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can&#146;t let&#151;(pause), actually
I kinda want to see what happens.</p>

<p>Joshua: Hey!</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi!</p>

<p>Joshua: Nice uh, costume.</p>

<p>Rachel: Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye
cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an &#145;E!&#146;</p>

<p>All: E!</p>

<p>Rachel: Gimme an &#145;M!&#146;</p>

<p>All: M!</p>

<p>Rachel: Gimme an &#145;I!&#146;</p>

<p>All: I!</p>

<p>Rachel: Gimme an &#145;L!&#146;</p>

<p>All: L!</p>

<p>Rachel: Gimme a &#145;Y!&#146;</p>

<p>All: Y!</p>

<p>Rachel: What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and
performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) Emil&#151;Whoa!! (She falls in
Chandler&#146;s room.) Okay! So that&#146;s me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Gunther&#146;s
the only one that claps.)</p>

<p>(Joey and Monica rush over to her.)</p>


<p>Joey and Monica: Are you all right?</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m fine! I&#146;m fine! I&#146;m just losing a tooth, it&#146;s no
big deal. I have a dentist! Y&#146;know. I&#146;m gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me.
(She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do
now?</p>

<p>Monica: I think you&#146;re done.</p>

<p>Joey: Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)</p>

<p>Joshua: Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.</p>

<p>Joey: (trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.</p>

<p>Rachel: All right, come on, let&#146;s go get your coat.</p>

<p>Joshua: Okay.</p>

<p>(They both go to Chandler&#146;s bedroom to get his coat.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Gunther and Emily.]</p>

<p>Gunther: Rachel is my girlfriend.</p>

<p>[Cut to Chandler&#146;s bedroom.]</p>

<p>Joshua: So, this was uh, really fun.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Y&#146;know, this bra&#133;
Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Y&#146;know, this used to be my
bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could
talk, y&#146;know what they&#146;d say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently
pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isn&#146;t co-operating.)</p>

<p>Joshua: Need uh, need a little hand there.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.</p>

<p>Joshua: You really don&#146;t seem like you do. That&#146;s&#133;</p>

<p>(She is still yanking on the bra, but it is stuck in her sleeve. Finally, she gives
up.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not
how this is supposed to happen.</p>

<p>Joshua: Well, what was supposed to happen?</p>

<p>Rachel: Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that
if I could get you here, I could seduce you.</p>

<p>Joshua: Huh. Oh, boy! (Sits down next to her.) Uhh, I-I don&#146;t wear suits to
work, and I bought six of them from you.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, I&#146;m sorry, I thought you needed them!</p>

<p>Joshua: No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted
to see you.</p>

<p>Rachel: Why?!</p>

<p>Joshua: Because I-I like you.</p>

<p>Rachel: You like me?</p>

<p>Joshua: Yeah! I mean you&#146;re-you&#146;re beautiful and smart and
sophisticated&#151;a lot of this isn&#146;t based on tonight.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can&#146;t believe this, all
this time, I liked you and you liked me!</p>

<p>Joshua: But&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh no-no-no don&#146;t say but! No-no, but&#146;s never good! Let&#146;s
just leave it at, you like me and I like you.</p>

<p>Joshua: Okay uh, however&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, now see that&#146;s a fancy but.</p>

<p>Joshua: My marriage like just ended, and I&#146;m really not ready to get
into anything yet.</p>

<p>Rachel: But&#133;.</p>

<p>Joshua: I&#146;m sorry, I, I just need a little time.</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay.</p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway, Ross is sitting on the step drinking a beer as Rachel comes out of
the guys apartment.]</p>

<p>Rachel: Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua&#146;s gone so
you and Emily are free to go.</p>

<p>Ross: That&#146;s okay. She&#146;s still in there enjoying her fake party and
uh, it&#146;s too late to do any of the things I had planned, so&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, Ross, I&#146;m sorry. I completely ruined your evening.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.</p>

<p>Ross: Helps a little.</p>

<p>Rachel: Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, have a seat.</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m so sorry.</p>

<p>Ross: That&#146;s okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just
didn&#146;t want it to end this way, y&#146;know?</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, maybe you didn&#146;t want it to end?</p>

<p>Ross: What do you mean?</p>

<p>Rachel: You seem to really like her.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed
that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y&#146;know no commitment.</p>

<p>Rachel: Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,
asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica&#146;s photo albums, I mean you
don&#146;t do that if you&#146;re just in it for two weeks.</p>

<p>Ross: You think?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and
you&#146;re sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.</p>

<p>Ross: Hey, you&#146;re right.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah.</p>

<p>Ross: Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?</p>

<p>Rachel: I don&#146;t know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh my God! Those weren&#146;t albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
(He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Hey.</p>

<p>Chandler: Hey.</p>

<p>Rachel: You&#146;re a pathetic loser, right?</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh-ho, yeah!</p>

<p>Rachel: Sit!</p>

<p>(He does so, and immediately starts looking pathetic.)</p>

<p>Joshua: Hi. (He has just returned.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh my gosh, Joshua!</p>

<p>Joshua: All those things I said about not being ready&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: They&#146;re not true?</p>

<p>Joshua: No, they&#146;re-they&#146;re all true.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh.</p>

<p>Joshua: But&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh! Oh, I love that but.</p>

<p>(They move to kiss, but realise that Chandler is staring at them. Chandler urges them
on.)</p>

<p>Rachel: You wanna go inside and have some coffee?</p>

<p>Joshua: Yeah.</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, the next day. Phoebe is busy
making a sandwich.]</p>

<p>Joey: Oooh, what you got there?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Pastrami.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y&#146;know what goes good with that?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hm-mm, corn beef.</p>

<p>Joey: Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that&#146;s much better. How about a
little of that smoked turkey?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay.</p>

<p>Joey: (He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is
the baby due?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Six months.</p>

<p>Joey: Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those
right?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Not if I get there first.</p>
