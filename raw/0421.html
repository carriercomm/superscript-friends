<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are sitting and talking.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Y&#146;know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has
happened.</p>

<p>Joey: I know. Ross is getting married.</p>

<p>Chandler: Phoebe is, making people.</p>

<p>Joey: Everybody&#146;s doing stuff!</p>

<p>Chandler: And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even
know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something.
Okay? Something huge!</p>

<p>Joey: (snaps his fingers) We could climb Mt. Everest!</p>

<p>Chandler: No-no, not something stupid, something huge.</p>

<p>Joey: No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing
everyday! We could totally do that!</p>

<p>Chandler: Why not?! I mean it&#146;s just, it&#146;s just climbing! It&#146;s
just, it&#146;s just steep!</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah!</p>

<p>Chandler: We&#146;re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass
print on Everest!</p>

<p>Phoebe: (entering) Hey!</p>

<p>Joey: Hey!</p>

<p>Phoebe: What-what&#146;s up?</p>

<p>Joey: We&#146;re gonna climb Mt. Everest!</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah baby!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and
y&#146;know you can die. And, you would die!</p>

<p>Chandler: (dejected) Yeah, well&#133;</p>

<p>Joey: We could get that Everest video though.</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah, we could do that without y&#146;know risking our lives at all!</p>

<p>Joey: And while we&#146;re down at the video store, you know what else we could
rent? <i>Die Hard</i>! (Chandler&#146;s excited.) Oh, y&#146;know what? I just remembered,
that Everest thing is only available through mail order.</p>

<p>Chandler: (dejected) Oh, well&#133;</p>

<p>Phoebe: So you guys&#146;ll stay here and hang out with me?</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeeeeahhhh.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>Chandler: But I&#146;ll tell you something. One of these days we&#146;re get off
of our buts and rent <i>Die Hard</i> again!</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah we are!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s apartment, he and Emily are addressing their invitations.]</p>

<p>Emily: So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?</p>

<p>Ross: Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he&#146;s so cheap, he&#146;d never fly to
London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough? (Hands her
some envelopes.)</p>

<p>Emily: Yeah, they&#146;re fine.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah?</p>

<p>Emily: If anyone asks, we&#146;ll just say Ben addressed them. (Looking through
the envelopes.) Oh! So you invited Rachel then?</p>

<p>Ross: Sure. Why not?</p>

<p>Emily: Really?</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah?</p>

<p>Emily: I don&#146;t think I&#146;d be comfortable with any of my old lovers
there.</p>

<p>Ross: Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn&#146;t invite her?</p>

<p>Emily: Oh, no-no, y&#146;know I absolutely adore Rachel it&#146;s just that,
well it might be a awkward for you. But it&#146;s absolutely your decision. (Gets up.)
More tea?</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah sure.</p>

<p>Emily: Earl Grey?</p>

<p>Ross: Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.</p>

<p>Rachel: I knew.</p>

<p>Ross: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky
older brother.</p>

<p>Rachel: I did.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here&#151;but do you think it would be okay if I asked you
out? Sometime? Maybe?</p>

<p><strong>Rachel:</strong> (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?</p>

<p>Ross: You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>Rachel: I could not have done this without you.</p>

<p>(Rachel stands up and kisses Ross. He is stunned. A moment of silence follows.)</p>

you&#146;ve grown. Y'know?&nbsp; I mean my Mom never thought this would work out.
It was all, &#147;Once a cheater, always a cheater.&#148;&nbsp; Ooh, I just wish we

<p>Rachel: Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends,
asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica&#146;s photo albums, I mean you
don&#146;t do that if you&#146;re just in it for two weeks.</p>

together again! We are so over!!</p>

<p>Ross: (starts to cry) FINE BY ME!! (he opens the door and traps Chandler behind
it)</p>

<p>[cut to later]</p>

<p>Rachel: And hey! Just so you know, it&#146;s not that common! It doesn&#146;t
happen to every guy! And it is a big deal!!</p>

<p>Chandler: I KNEW IT!!!!</p>

<p>[cut back to the present.]</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is deciding on whether or not to go to the wedding.]</p>

<p>[cut to another clip, this one is from The One With The Prom Video]</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is watching the Prom Video and Rachel is about to
make her entrance on the video.&nbsp; The italics are portions of the prom video.]</p>

<p><i><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Rachel's coming up the path.&nbsp; Doesn't she look
pretty. Jack... (Rachel enters with a huge nose)</i></p>

<p><a name="line22"></a>Rachel: Oh my God.</p>

<p>Monica: You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh.</p>

<p>Ross: You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this.</p>

<p><strong>All:</strong> Oh yeah we do. C'mon.</p>

<p><i><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Get a shot of Monica. Where's Monica.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> Wait, how do you zoom out? (zooms out and we see an
extremely overweight Monica eating a big sandwich) There she is.</i></p>

<p><a name="line23"></a>Monica: Shut up, the camera adds ten pounds.</p>

<p>Chandler: Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?</p>

<p>[cut to later]</p>

<p><i><strong>Monica:</strong> Oh, dad, turn it off.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> It is off.&nbsp; Right Ross? (pans over to see Ross with
an afro and moustache)</i></p>

<p>Joey: Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.</p>

<p>[cut to later]</p>

<p><i><strong>Rachel:</strong> I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too
late.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> If you're not going then I don't want to go either.</i></p>

<p><i><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> (to Ross on the stairs) I have a wonderful idea. You
should take Rachel to the prom.</i></p>

<p>[cut to later]</p>

<p>Ross: Y'know what?&nbsp; I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.</p>

<p><strong>All:</strong> No, no, no.</p>

<p>Ross: OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.</p>

<p><i><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> C'mon kid, let's go.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Ahh, are you hadsome.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> Let's show 'em.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (walks down the stairs and grabs the flowers out of the vase on
the endtable) Okay dad.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Geller:</strong> (going downstairs) Rachel, ready or not, here comes your
knight in shining&#151;Oh no. (Chip has shown up and the four are leaving.)</p>

<p><strong>Rachel, Monica, Roy, and Chip:</strong> Bye.</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Geller:</strong> Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?</p>

<p></i>Monica: (to Ross) I can't believe you did that.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, well.</p>

<p>[Rachel, seeing what he did for her, gets up, walks across the room, and kisses Ross]</p>

<p>Phoebe: See, he's her lobster.</p>

<p>[Cut back to the present, Rachel has made her decision.]</p>

<p>Monica: (seeing the decision) Nooooo. You&#146;re really not going?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah. It&#146;s just gonna be too hard. Y&#146;know? I mean, it&#146;s
Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y&#146;know it&#146;s just, it&#146;s for the best,
y&#146;know it is, it&#146;s&#133; Y&#146;know, plus, somebody&#146;s got to stay here
with Phoebe! Y&#146;know she&#146;s gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to
help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.</p>

<p>Monica: You don&#146;t have a car. And your license expired. </p>

<p>Rachel: I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there&#146;s so much to do and I have
so little time to do it in.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are reading a book about things to do
whilst in London.]</p>

<p>Chandler: All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that
there&#146;s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! (Reading from the
book.) &quot;It&#146;s almost as good as being there.&quot;</p>

<p>Joey: It&#146;s better! You can&#146;t go to a museum in your underwear!</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Chandler: </strong>Well, You could, but... probably just the one
time.</p>

<p><strong>Joey: </strong>I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our
hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!</p>

<p><strong>Chandler: </strong>If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.</p>

<p><strong>Joey:</strong> Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!</p>
