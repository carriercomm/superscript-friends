<p>[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel is getting a cup of coffee as Joey and Phoebe enter and
sit down.]</p>


<p>Phoebe: Oh! Hey, Rach!</p>


<p>Rachel: Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine&#146;s Day!</p>


<p>Phoebe: Oh, you, too.</p>


<p>Joey: Hey, so, uh, how&#146;s it going living over at Ross&#146;?</p>


<p>Rachel: It&#146;s good. Except he makes us watch the <i>Discovery Channel </i>all
day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the
Middle Ages? (to the waitress handing her a cup of coffee) Oh, thank you. I&#146;ll see
you guys later.</p>


<p>Phoebe: Okay.</p>


<p>Joey: Bye.</p>

<p>(Rachel exits with coffee)</p>


<p>Joey: There&#146;s one lucky to-go cup of coffee.</p>


<p>Phoebe: (sighs) Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this.
Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?</p>


<p>Joey: Thanks. But maybe later.</p>


<p>Phoebe: Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?</p>


<p>Gunther: (to Joey) You want anything?</p>


<p>Joey: You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I
love on Valentine&#146;s Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment
of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that&#146;s never going to happen!</p>


<p>Gunther: We have red bagels.</p>


<p>Joey: Oh, okay. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Opening Credits</p>


<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler&#146;s. Phoebe and Ross are sitting in the living room
talking.]</p>


<p>Phoebe: So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?</p>


<p>Ross: Oh, I&#146;m actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she&#146;s been
away all week visiting her parents, but she&#146;ll be cool. I mean, she&#146;s been so
supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, &#145;Fossils are my
friends.&#146;</p>


<p>Phoebe: Ugh. Come on, Mona, don&#146;t kiss ass.</p>


<p>Ross: Uh, I&#146;m going to take off.</p>


<p>Phoebe: All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!</p>


<p>Ross: What is it?</p>


<p>Phoebe: It&#146;s a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back
to your apartment?</p>


<p>Ross: All right. (reading the label) &#145;Candy and Cookie?&#146;</p>


<p>Phoebe: Yeah. Candy&#146;s the mother, Cookie&#146;s the daughter. The
father&#146;s also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?</p>


<p>Monica: (entering with something behind her back) Phoebe, c&#146;mere. I want to
show you something in the bathroom.</p>


<p>Phoebe: Oh, Monica, grow up!</p>


<p>Ross: Hey, what&#146;s behind your back?</p>


<p>Monica: Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe&#146;s opinion on for
Valentine&#146;s Day.</p>


<p>Ross: You don&#146;t want my opinion?</p>


<p>Monica: Not really.</p>


<p>Ross: Come on, I&#146;m your older brother, ask me!</p>


<p>Monica: All right, big brother. (holds up two erm&#133;revealing articles of
clothing) Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your
best friend would want to do her?</p>


<p>Ross: (quietly) The red one.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and&#133;wait&#133;just Joey&#146;s. Joey is sitting at the counter eating
a pizza.]</p>


<p>Phoebe: (knocking and entering) Hey. Look, I know you&#146;ve been really depressed
lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real,
live, furry playmate.</p>


<p>Joey: No, I&#146;m not sleeping with your friend Jane again.</p>

<p>(Phoebe goes into the hall and brings a dog inside!)</p>


<p>Phoebe: He-hee!</p>


<p>Joey: Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.</p>


<p>Phoebe: This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy.
Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!</p>


<p>Joey: Thanks so much, Pheebs! (to the dog) We are going to have so much fun, yes we
are! (the dog sticks his head between Joey&#146;s legs) Oh! Not that kind of fun.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler&#146;s. Chandler enters with a bouquet of roses.]</p>


<p>Chandler: Happy Valentine&#146;s!</p>


<p>Monica: (from her bedroom) Okay! I&#146;ll be right out. I&#146;m slipping into
something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.</p>


<p>Chandler: (picking up a video from the table) &#145;Candy and Cookie&#146;.
&#145;Candy and Cookie?&#146; Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must
love me!! (Chandler runs over to the TV, puts the tape in, and sits down to enjoy some
&quot;porn&quot;)</p>

<p>(A woman on TV breaths hard)</p>


<p>Man on TV: Yeah, just relax.</p>


<p>Chandler: I love you, St. Valentine.</p>

<p>(The woman groans, moans, grunts, and screams. Chandler&#146;s eyes get huge!)</p>


<p>Chandler: Woah, woah, that&#146;s not pretty!</p>


<p>Man on TV: Now, push!</p>


<p>Woman on TV: Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts!</p>


<p>Chandler: Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever! (Chandler starts to press buttons on
the remote control, frantically.)</p>


<p>Woman on TV: Ohhh! Make it stop!</p>


<p>Chandler: I am trying!</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey&#146;s. Joey is playing fetch with the dog.]</p>


<p>Joey: Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! (Joey pretends to throw it,
but really doesn&#146;t, and the dog goes running off.) Well, you&#146;re cute, but
you&#146;re not too smart! </p>

<p>(The dog returns with a ball that looks exactly like the same one Joey has.)</p>


<p>Joey: (looking at the ball the dog brought back) Did I just throw this?</p>


<p>Rachel: (entering) Hi.</p>


<p>Joey: Hi.</p>


<p>Rachel: I accidentally packed these with my stuff. (looks at the dog and gasps) Who
is this?</p>


<p>Joey: Oh, that&#146;s, uh, that&#146;s Phoebe&#146;s friend&#146;s dog. I
don&#146;t know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.</p>


<p>Rachel: (talking with a higher voice, and puckered lips&#133;kind of like you do to
a baby or...well&#133;a puppy&#133;it&#146;s hard to explain. Just use your imagination!)
Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I&#146;ve got to go to
work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do.
(still talking like that) Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can&#146;t stop it. (exits)</p>


<p>Joey: (to the dog) C&#146;mere. Hey. C&#146;mere. That&#146;s Rachel. She&#146;s
the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you&#151;we love her. But we
can&#146;t have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You&#146;re a
guy. (thinks about it and picks up the dog and looks) Well, you used to be.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler&#146;s. Chandler is sitting on the couch staring at the
tape on the coffee table with his eyes huge and his mouth wide open.]</p>


<p>Monica: (entering from her bedroom) So what do you think? (referring to her outfit)</p>

<p>(Chandler glances up at Monica with his mouth still wide open and his eyes still huge)</p>


<p>Monica: (to herself) I&#146;ve still got it!</p>


<p>Chandler: (pointing at the video) Why did you get me this?</p>


<p>Monica: What is it?</p>


<p>Chandler: It&#146;s yelling&#133;bleeding&#133;dilating. Oh, the dilating&#133;</p>


<p>Monica: Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe&#146;s.
Why were you even watching it?</p>


<p>Chandler: I thought&#133;maybe&#133;you got me porn for Valentine&#146;s Day.</p>


<p>Monica: Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine&#146;s
Day&#133; (pulls a video out of a basket) you were right! Apparently, it&#146;s about a
young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having
sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! (looks closer) Oh, wait a minute. Those
aren&#146;t stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?</p>


<p>Chandler: Well, I&#146;m not really in a sexy mood right now.</p>


<p>Monica: Honey, what&#146;s going on?</p>


<p>Chandler: Well, remember the first time we saw<i> Jaws</i>?</p>


<p>Monica: Mm-hmm.</p>


<p>Chandler: How long it took to go back in the water?</p>


<p>Monica: Chandler, we can&#146;t let this tape wreck Valentine&#146;s Day!</p>


<p>Chandler: You don&#146;t know. You didn&#146;t see it.</p>


<p>Monica: Child-birth, it&#146;s a natural thing! It&#146;s beautiful.</p>


<p>Chandler: Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful? (picks up
the remote and presses a button, and he immediately makes a face that just looks like
he&#146;s going to throw up!)</p>


<p>Monica: Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!</p>


<p>Chandler: See, honey, there&#146;s&#151;(puts his hand on her leg)</p>


<p>Monica: Don&#146;t touch me!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk. Ross is sitting on the couch reading a magazine as Mona enters.]</p>


<p>Mona: Hi!</p>


<p>Ross: Hey! (they hug) So, how was Atlantic City?</p>


<p>Mona: Good.</p>


<p>Ross: Yeah?</p>


<p>Mona: I brought you back a present.</p>


<p>Ross: Wha&#151;? Oh, come on. You didn&#146;t have to&#151;saltwater taffy?! (Mona
laughs) Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea
water, but it&#146;s actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That&#146;s not
interesting.</p>


<p>Mona: I think it&#146;s interesting.</p>


<p>Ross: I do too! I missed you!</p>


<p>Mona: I missed you, too! So, how was your week?</p>


<p>Ross: Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!</p>


<p>Mona: How exciting!</p>


<p>Ross: Yeah! I know! It was. Oh&#133; the only sad thing is I wasn&#146;t around
when it happened for the first time.</p>


<p>Mona: Oh no.</p>


<p>Ross: Yeah, I&#146;m missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested
Rachel move in with me.</p>


<p>Mona: (laughing) Yeah right!</p>


<p>Ross: What?</p>


<p>Mona: Joey cracks me up! It&#146;s like, &#145;Yeah, why don&#146;t you have your
ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn&#146;t be awkward at all!&#146; (she laughs again)</p>


<p>Ross: (not amused) Huh&#133;uh-huh.</p>


<p>Mona: Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my
boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant! (Mona laughs&#133;yes&#133;again!)</p>

<p>(Ross fake laughs, obviously not finding this funny, and he&#146;s starting to panic,
so he shoves the whole saltwater taffy he&#146;s eating in his mouth)</p>


<p>Mona: So, what&#146;d you tell him?</p>


<p>Ross: (with his mouth full) Just a second! (he fake laughs, but turns his head and
starts to break down)</p>


<p ALIGN="CENTER">Commercial Break</p>


<p>[Scene: Central Perk. Ross and Phoebe are sitting on the couch.]</p>


<p>Phoebe: How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?</p>


<p>Ross: I don&#146;t know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus,
she, uh, she got me taffy!</p>


<p>Phoebe: Taffy, really? I&#146;ve never had any.</p>


<p>Ross: Ever?!</p>


<p>Phoebe: Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide
saltwater treats. (Ross hands her one) Thank you! So what, you&#146;re just never going to
tell her?</p>


<p>Ross: Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know,
I&#146;m going to take her to an amazing Valentine&#146;s dinner. Do all this romantic
stuff, and then, just when she thinks I&#146;m the best boyfriend in the world, then
I&#146;m going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.</p>


<p>Phoebe: If I haven&#146;t said it before: she&#146;s a lucky, lucky lady! So, where
are you going to&#151;what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? (Referring to the
taffy, which she&#146;s been chewing this whole time.) Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food?
What&#146;s the deal? (she swallows it, finally) Oh, it&#146;s nice! May I try a pink one?</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey&#146;s. Joey is laying on his recliner, depressed, and the dog is laying
on the footrest.]</p>


<p>Joey: So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just
isn&#146;t going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.</p>


<p>Phoebe: (entering) Hey!</p>


<p>Joey: Hey.</p>


<p>Phoebe: Hey, buddy. How&#146;s my favorite dog, huh? How&#146;s my favorite dog?
(the dog doesn&#146;t move) You&#146;re subdued. (to Joey) Did you give him a beer?</p>


<p>Joey: No.</p>


<p>Phoebe: Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.</p>


<p>Joey: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. (pause) Oh, me, right!</p>

<p>(Joey follows Phoebe into the kitchen)</p>


<p>Phoebe: He&#146;s miserable! What happened to him?</p>


<p>Joey: Nothing. We just talked about stuff.</p>


<p>Phoebe: What stuff?</p>


<p>Joey: Rachel stuff.</p>


<p>Phoebe: Oh&#133;Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world,
and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!</p>


<p>Joey: He&#146;s breathing!</p>


<p>Phoebe: Okay, I&#146;m going to take him back to Wendy&#146;s.</p>


<p>Joey: No, no, no, no! He&#146;s fine! Look, look, look! (picks up the ball)
Here&#146;s your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! (he throws the ball and it bounces
right next to the dog) Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the
dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and&#133;Rachel&#146;s&#133;I guess I have to call it that now. Rachel is
reading on the couch as Ross enters.]</p>


<p>Ross: Well, I&#146;m, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?</p>


<p>Rachel: Oh, I&#146;ve got big Valentine&#146;s plans! I&#146;ve got my Chinese food
on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!</p>


<p>Ross: Y&#146;know, it&#146;s interesting! Most people think that&#146;s made with
seawater, when in fact&#151;</p>


<p>Rachel: Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.</p>

<p>(There is a knock on the door.)</p>


<p>Rachel: Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash! (runs to her room to get her
money)</p>


<p>Ross: (opening the door to see Mona standing there) Mona? What are&#151;hi! What
are you doing here? I&#146;m, um, supposed to pick you up!</p>


<p>Mona: Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine&#146;s dinner! Surprise!</p>


<p>Ross: (he makes some really weird noise hear that sounds kind of
like&#133;)Ayyyayyyy!</p>


<p>Rachel: (entering) Oh, hey, Mona!</p>


<p>Mona: Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel! (to Ross) What&#146;s she doing here?</p>


<p>Ross: I have no idea!</p>


<p>Rachel: I&#146;ll be watching TV if anybody needs me. (exits to her room)</p>


<p>Mona: Seriously, what is she doing?</p>


<p>Ross: Uh&#133;lately, she just likes hanging out here.</p>


<p>Mona: Why?</p>


<p>Ross: I think she&#146;s lonely.</p>


<p>Mona: Okay, but it&#146;s Valentine&#146;s Day!</p>


<p>Ross: I know.</p>


<p>Mona: Can&#146;t we just ask her to go?</p>


<p>Ross: No, no. She&#146;s way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.</p>

<p>(Doorbell rings)</p>


<p>Rachel: I&#146;m not here! That&#146;s just my Chinese food!</p>


<p>Mona: Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?</p>


<p>Ross: Mm-hmm. She&#146;s&#151;she&#146;s emotional, but, but ballsy.</p>


<p>Rachel: You know what I&#146;m going to do? I&#146;m going to get in my sweats, and
eat this in bed! (exits)</p>


<p>Ross: And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don&#146;t you, uh,
open the champagne, and I&#146;ll be right back. I&#146;ve got a surprise for you.</p>


<p>Mona: You got another ex-wife back there?</p>


<p>Ross: (fakes a laugh) Please start drinking! (exits)</p>


<p>Rachel: (entering) I&#146;m just going to grab the phone.</p>


<p>Mona: Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you don&#146;t take this the wrong way, but,
but, um&#133; what are you doing?</p>


<p>Rachel: Oh, I&#146;m sorry! Do you need the phone?</p>


<p>Mona: No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment,
and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don&#146;t you go back to your place and
give us some privacy?</p>


<p>Rachel: (as Ross enters with a present) But, but, Mona, I live here.</p>


<p>Ross: (handing Mona the present) Happy Valentine&#146;s Day! &#133;Or something to
remember me by.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler&#146;s. Monica and Chandler are sitting on the couch still
staring at the screen.]</p>


<p>Monica: How long has it been this time?</p>


<p>Chandler: 90 seconds.</p>


<p>Monica: That&#146;s better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about
it&#133;except all I did was think about it.</p>


<p>Chandler: You know, it haunts me? Up &#145;til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was
my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that
my screensaver!</p>


<p>Monica: Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don&#146;t we get rid of the tape
and pretend it never existed?</p>


<p>Chandler: I can do that.</p>


<p>Monica: Okay.</p>

<p>(Chandler takes the tape and sticks it under the chair cushion)</p>


<p>Chandler: Okay. Now all we&#146;ve got to do is get rid of this chair.</p>

<p>(Chandler crawls over to Monica and they move in to kiss, but they can&#146;t do it and
back up. They move in to kiss again, and kiss very awkwardly for a second, until someone
knocks on the door.)</p>


<p>Monica: Oh, thank God!</p>


<p>Chandler: Oh, I know!</p>


<p>Monica: Come in!</p>


<p>Rachel: (entering) Hi! I&#146;m so sorry to barge in on your Valentine&#146;s, but
I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.</p>


<p>Monica: Oh, my God.</p>


<p>Chandler: Poor Ross.</p>

<p>(Monica and Chandler both look at each other and run over to the window to watch the
action in Ross&#146; apartment)</p>


<p>Chandler: Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he
closes the drapes!</p>


<p>Monica: Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It&#146;s here.</p>


<p>Chandler: Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don&#146;t watch it.</p>


<p>Rachel: Why? You saw it? Is it scary?</p>


<p>Chandler: Well, let&#146;s just say it&#146;s ironic how footage of someone being
born can make you want to kill yourself.</p>


<p>Rachel: Well, now, wait. Now I&#146;m all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch
it with me.</p>


<p>Monica: No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!</p>


<p>Rachel: C&#146;mon, seriously, you guys, you&#146;re not going to make me watch
this alone!</p>


<p>Monica: She&#146;s right&#133;of course not. Honey, get the tape.</p>


<p>Chandler: (with his arm all the way under the cushion, moving it around) This
reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. (Chandler puts the tape in, and they all
sit down) Okay, here we go.</p>


<p>Rachel: Okay. (watching the tape) Ooh, my! (Rachel jumps when the woman starts
screaming) Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!</p>


<p>Chandler: Why have I seen this thing three times?!</p>


<p>Monica: It&#146;s&#133;still beautiful.</p>


<p>Rachel: Uh! It&#146;s horrible!</p>


<p>Monica: I know! I know, I&#146;m so sorry for you!</p>


<p>Rachel: Oh, my God!</p>

<p>(Monica and Rachel both cover their eyes)</p>


<p>Chandler: Wait, you guys, look!</p>


<p>Rachel: What? Did her ass explode?!</p>


<p>Chandler: No, the baby&#146;s out! Look, look!</p>


<p>Monica: Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!</p>


<p>Chandler: And look how happy the mom is now!</p>


<p>Monica: Oh&#133;Rach!</p>


<p>Rachel: Oh, screw you guys, you don&#146;t have to do it!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk. Ross is getting coffee as Joey comes from&#133;God knows where!
Some back area of Central Perk around the corner that we&#146;ve never seen!
Weeeiiirrrddd&#133;.]</p>


<p>Ross: Hey, hey, man!</p>


<p>Joey: Hey, what&#146;s up?</p>


<p>Ross: Uh&#133;Mona just dumped me.</p>


<p>Joey: Oh, man, I&#146;m sorry. Why?</p>


<p>Ross: Well, with everything that&#146;s been going on lately, I haven&#146;t
exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn&#146;t tell her I got Rachel
pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I
lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not
breaking up with me sooner, you know?</p>


<p>Joey: Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine&#146;s Day.</p>


<p>Ross: Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date
on Valentine&#146;s Day? What&#146;s going on, huh? Girl trouble?</p>


<p>Joey: Sort of.</p>


<p>Ross: Really?!</p>


<p>Joey: You don&#146;t have to seem so happy about it.</p>


<p>Ross: Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.</p>


<p>Joey: Oh, I&#133;I d&#151;</p>


<p>Ross: Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y&#146;know, actually
once&#151;once I got dumped during sex.</p>

<p>(Two girls sitting at a table next to them look up in disgust, and Ross and Joey move
away)</p>


<p>Ross: Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?</p>


<p>Joey: Forget about it. It&#146;s no big deal.</p>


<p>Ross: C&#146;mon! Joey! What is it?</p>


<p>Joey: It&#146;s nothing.</p>


<p>Ross: Hey, hey, it&#146;s me. Why can&#146;t you tell me?</p>


<p>Joey: Okay, uh&#133;sit down. (they do) Um&#133; there&#146;s this woman that I
like. A lot. But, uh&#133;it can&#146;t happen.</p>


<p>Ross: She&#146;s not a Tribbiani?</p>


<p>Joey: No!</p>


<p>Ross: I knew it. So, is she someone from work?</p>


<p>Joey: Yes.</p>


<p>Ross: Well, uh, does she like you?</p>


<p>Joey: Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn&#146;t matter, because I
can&#146;t do anything about it.</p>


<p>Ross: Why not?</p>


<p>Joey: Well, it&#146;s complicated. She&#146;s with this other guy. For a long time.
Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we&#146;re really
good friends.</p>


<p>Ross: So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh&#133; is he still in love
with her?</p>


<p>Joey: No. I don&#146;t think so.</p>


<p>Ross: Okay. Um&#133; is he a good guy?</p>


<p>Joey: Yeah, he&#146;s the best.</p>


<p>Ross: Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.</p>


<p>Joey: Oh, I don&#146;t know.</p>


<p>Ross: Joey, it&#146;s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.</p>


<p>Joey: I do! So much! I can&#146;t stop thinking about her! I can&#146;t sleep,
I&#151;</p>


<p>Ross: Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen
to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.</p>


<p>Gunther: (placing a cup in front of Ross) Here&#146;s your warm milk.</p>


<p>Ross: I&#146;m going to&#133;uh&#133;I&#146;m going to, um, put the bourbon in it
at home.</p>


<p>Joey: Oh, yeah.</p>


<p>Ross: Anyway&#133; seriously, uh&#133;just&#133;just talk to the guy, okay? And
tell me how it goes. (walks towards the door until&#133;)</p>


<p>Joey: It&#146;s Rachel.</p>

<p>(Ross just stands in the doorway, for like a minute&#133;Ahh! What&#146;s going to
happen next??!!! I can&#146;t make it all the way through the Olympics!!!)</p>

prepared. Now, you&#146;re going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!</i>
(Rachel puts the tape in the VCR)</p>


<p>Woman on TV: I came to the big city to become a star! I&#146;ll do&#133;anything to
make that happen!</p>


<p>Man on TV: Anything?</p>

<p>(Music starts playing&#133;yes&#133;you know what kind of music&#133;)</p>
