<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Gunther is pouring Rachel coffee.]</p>

<p>Gunther: Here you go.</p>

<p>Rachel: Thank you.</p>

<p>Gunther: (In his head) <i>Say Rachel, I was wondering if you&#146;d like to go
to a movie with me sometime. As my lover! Nnnsch, to out there. Maybe you&#146;d just like
to ah, get something to eat with me sometime? As my lover.</i></p>

<p>Mark: (entering) Hi!</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi! All right, let&#146;s go shoppin&#146;!!</p>

<p>Mark: Um, y'know, before we go ah, there&#146;s something I need to say.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>Mark: I&#146;ve kinda of had this ah, this crush on you. (Rachel is shocked) But
since you were with Ross, I-I didn&#146;t do anything about it. But, now that you&#146;re
not, I&#146;d really like to ask you out sometime. So-so that&#146;s-that&#146;s what
I&#146;m doing, now.</p>

<p>(Gunther gets this hurt expression on his face and goes into the back room)</p>

<p>Rachel: Wow! Umm....</p>

<p>(She&#146;s interrupted by a loud crash and the sound of braking dishes. Followed
quickly by another crash. Everyone turns and looks at the back room, as Gunther emerges.)</p>

<p>Gunther: I dropped a cup.</p>

<p align="center">Opening Credits</p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway between the two apartments, Pete and Monica are returning from
their date.]</p>

<p>Pete: ...so y'know, that&#146;s why, within a few years, that voice recognition
is gonna be pretty much standard on any computer you buy. Y'know, so you could be
like-like, &#145;Wash my car.&#146; &#145;Clean my room.&#146; It&#146;s not gonna be able
to do any of those things, but it&#146;ll understand what you&#146;re saying.</p>

<p>Monica: Oh, this is so great.</p>

<p>Pete: Yeah, it was.</p>

<p>Monica: All right then. (He leans in to kiss her goodnight, but she quickly
kisses him on the cheek and pats his shoulder.) Bye.</p>

<p>(She goes into her apartment and sees Chandler, Phoebe, and Ross sitting there.)</p>

<p>Monica: Hello, people who do not live here.</p>

<p>All: Hi! Hello!</p>

<p>Monica: I gave you a key for emergencies!</p>

<p>Phoebe: We were out of <i>Doritos</i>.</p>

<p>Ross: Hey, how&#146;d the date go with Mr. Millionaire?</p>

<p>Chandler: Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold
separately.</p>

<p>Monica: He&#146;s great! I mean we have such a good time together! He&#146;s so
funny, and sooo sweet, and I&#146;m not attracted to him at all!!</p>

<p>Ross: Still?!</p>

<p>Monica: Noo!! It&#146;s driving me crazy. I mean every other way he&#146;s like
the perfect guy, he has everything. Plus! He actually has everything.</p>

<p>Chandler: Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from <i>Sharper Image</i>?</p>

<p>Monica: Two.</p>

<p>Chandler: Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?</p>

<p>Joey: (entering, dancing and singing) Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old
baddie! Oh mommie, oh daddie, I am a big old baddie! (He dances around the dinner table
and exits)</p>

<p>Ross: I guess he musta gotten the part in that play.</p>

<p>Monica and Phoebe: Oh.</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm
is going to get you.</p>

<p>[Scene: A Theatre, Joey is arriving to rehearse the play he&#146;s in.]</p>

<p>The Director: Joe. How&#146;s it going?</p>

<p>Joey: Good. (He sets his stuff down and starts talking to Kate, another cast
member.) Hey.</p>

<p>Kate: Hi.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, so you&#146;re playing Adrienne, huh?</p>

<p>Kate: Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I&#146;m Joey Tribianni.</p>

<p>Kate: Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller. </p>

<p>(She goes over to the snack table, and Joey quickly runs over and pours her a cup of
coffee.)</p>

<p>Joey: So the ah, play&#146;s pretty great, huh?</p>

<p>Kate: Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray&#146;s work. She&#146;s so
brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle
class.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, forget about it. She rocks!</p>

<p>Kate: Where do I know you from?</p>

<p>Joey: Dr. Drake Remoray. <i>Days of Our Lives</i>. Voted most datable
neurosurgeon by <em>Teen Beat</em>.</p>

<p>Kate: No, that&#146;s not it. So, you&#146;re a soap actor? Well this must be
pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, I&#146;ve done plays before. I&#146;m a serious actor.</p>

<p>Kate: That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing!
You&#146;re-you&#146;re-you&#146;re the guy that doesn&#146;t know how to pour milk!!</p>

<p>Joey: See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I
couldn&#146;t. Now, see, that&#146;s acting.</p>

<p align="left">Kate: Right, at the end, you choked on a cookie.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, that was real.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is telling Phoebe about Mark, as Gunther eavesdrops behind
them.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Wow! I cannot believe Mark asked you out.</p>

<p>Rachel: I know.</p>

<p>Phoebe: What, so what are you gonna tell him?</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, I told him I would think about it, but I&#146;m gonna tell him no.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Huh.</p>

<p>(Gunther tries to swoop in to ask Rachel out.)</p>

<p>Rachel: I mean I think I&#146;d say no to anybody right now. (Hearing this
Gunther swoops back to cleaning tables.) Oh, but it was so strange. I mean I&#146;m
standing there with this charming, cute guy, who&#146;s asking me to go out with him,
which I&#146;m allowed to do, and I felt guilty. Y'know, like I&#146;d be cheating on Ross
or something.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Wow. So, okay, maybe that means that, you&#146;re not over Ross yet and
you have issues with your father.</p>

<p>Rachel: I don&#146;t have any issues with my Father.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay, so it&#146;s probably just the Ross thing then.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is telling Chandler about Kate.]</p>

<p>Joey: I hate this woman!! I hate her! She told everyone in the company about
that info-mercial, and now they all keep asking me to open their drinks. Okay, and
whenever I can&#146;t do it, they&#146;re all like-like laughing at me.</p>

<p>Ross: (entering) Hello.</p>

<p>Chandler and Joey: Hey!</p>

<p>Ross: So Rachel called. Wants to see me. Going over in a minute.</p>

<p>Joey: Wow, what-what do you think she wants?</p>

<p>Ross: Well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without
me.... a-sucks.</p>

<p>Chandler: It&#146;s possible. You are very loveable, I&#146;d miss you if I
broke up with you. (Ross glares at him) I was just trying to be supportive.</p>

<p>Ross: Then be supportive like a guy.</p>

<p>Chandler: (in a deep voice) If I broke up with you, I&#146;d miss you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is there as Ross enters, walking very confidently.]</p>

<p>Ross: Hi.</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi!</p>

<p>Ross: You ah, wanted to see me?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah. Ahh, here&#146;s a box of your stuff. (hands him a box)</p>

<p>Ross: What?!</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, y'know, it&#146;s just like hats, and a shirt, and CD&#146;s, just
sort of stuff that you&#146;ve left here.</p>

<p>Ross: What are you doing? Are you trying to hurt me? Or something?</p>

<p>Rachel: No. Ross, it, it just seems that y'know it&#146;s time we-we y'know,
move on. I mean, I mean don&#146;t&#146; you think?</p>

<p>Ross: Yes. </p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah?</p>

<p>Ross: Yes, I do.</p>

<p>Rachel: Good.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, I-I really do. (takes a dinosaur mug out of the box) Hey! This-this
was a gift?!</p>

<p>Rachel: Ross, you got that for free from the museum gift shop.</p>

<p>Ross: It&#146;s still a gift! I got it from the gift shop!</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay, all right, give me the mug! I&#146;ll keep the mug.</p>

<p>Ross: No!! Y'know-y'know don&#146;t do me any favours. In fact, where,
where&#146;s the rest of my stuff?! Huh? Like-like my umm, (picks up a book) Hey, this
book is mine!! And-and-and, and that T-shirt you sleep in? I&#146;d like that back too.
Yes, I do.</p>

<p>Rachel: You know how much I love that T-shirt! You never even where that
T-shirt!</p>

<p>Ross: I&#146;m just trying to help you, move on.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, you are a petty man. You are a petty, petty....</p>

<p>Ross: Petty...</p>

<p>Rachel: Petty... (goes into her room)</p>

<p>Ross: Petty...</p>

<p>Rachel: Petty...</p>

<p>Ross: Petty...</p>

<p>Rachel: Small...</p>

<p>Ross: Small... (Rachel comes back into the living room and catches Ross mocking
her.)</p>

<p>Rachel: You are so just doing this out of spite.</p>

<p>Ross: Awwwahuh, no, no, no!!</p>

<p>Rachel: Huh?</p>

<p>Ross: I&#146;m-I&#146;m gonna wear this all the time! I love this shirt!! (he
kisses the shirt)</p>

<p>Rachel: You have not worn that T-shirt since you were 15!! It doesn&#146;t even
fit you anymore!</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah...</p>

<p>Rachel: (imitating him) yeah-yeah-yeah!!</p>

<p>Ross: Oh-oh, okay, okay! (He quickly takes off his sweater in order to put on
the T-shirt. It&#146;s an old &#145;Frankie says relax&#146; T-shirt, that barely fits
him. Rachel nods her head in approval of the new look.) If you don&#146;t mind I&#146;m
gonna the rest of my stuff, and relax, in my favourite shirt. (Starts to leave) You have a
pleasant evening. (He exits and leaves the door open.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, the gang minus Rachel and Ross are talking to Pete.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: So, you&#146;re like a zillionaire? (Pete smiles and nods)</p>

<p>Chandler: And you&#146;re our age. You&#146;re our age.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Y'know what, you should like, you should buy a state and then just name
it after yourself.</p>

<p>Pete: What like Pete Dakota?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.</p>

<p>Chandler: That&#146;s not a state Joe.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?</p>

<p>Pete: I got to go, so ah, I&#146;ll see you guys later.</p>

<p>All: Okay.</p>

<p>Chandler: You&#146;re our age!</p>

<p>Pete: (to Monica, by the door) So ah, we on for tomorrow?</p>

<p>Monica: Absolutely! (He goes to kiss her, but she stops him and rubs his head
and says...) Now get out of here you!! (Pete leaves) (to the gang) Okay, I&#146;m running
out of places I can touch him! Look, is there something wrong with me? I mean why am I
only attracted to guys where there&#146;s no future? Either they&#146;re too old, or
they&#146;re too young, and then there&#146;s Pete who&#146;s-who&#146;s crazy about me,
and who&#146;s absolutely perfect for me, and there&#146;s like zip going on! I mean,
seriously, does it sound like something&#146;s wrong with me?!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, kinda.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Theatre, Joey and Kate are rehearsing for the play.]</p>

<p>Kate: Happy?! Is that what I&#146;m supposed to be Vic? Happy?</p>

<p>Joey: Well, why don&#146;t you tell me what you&#146;re supposed to be! Huh?
Because I sure as hell can&#146;t figure it out! I talk to you and nothin&#146;. You look
at me, and it&#146;s nothin&#146;. (He kisses her) Nothing.</p>

<p>The Director: Tasty! I&#146;m really starting to feel like you guys have a
history, it&#146;s-it&#146;s nice.</p>

<p>Kate: I have a question about this scene.</p>

<p>The Director: Yes?</p>

<p>Kate: Well, I don&#146;t understand why Adrienne&#146;s attracted to Victor.</p>

<p>The Director: Peel the onion. First of all, he&#146;s good looking.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah.</p>

<p>Kate: I think my character&#146;s gonna need a little bit more of reason than
that.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it&#146;s says so in the script! Y'know
ah, I-I don&#146;t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script
here that you&#146;re a bitch.</p>

<p>Kate: It doesn&#146;t say that in the script.</p>

<p>Joey: It does in mine!</p>

<p>[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler and Ross are returning from working out.]</p>

<p>Chandler: I can blow dry it. I can put gel on it. It doesn&#146;t matter, I
still wind up with this little (pats the flat spot on the back of his head) cowlicky thing
on the middle part of my head. It&#146;s so annoying. Does it bug you?</p>

<p>Ross: You bug me.</p>

<p>[Rachel comes out of her apartment, followed by Mark, and they leave on their date,
without saying a word to Ross. Ross is stunned.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Is there any chance you didn&#146;t see that?</p>

<p align="center">Commercial Break</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching a basketball game, Ross is staring
out the peephole.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You can&#146;t just stare through the
peep hole for three hours! You&#146;re gonna get peep eye!</p>

<p>Ross: I knew it! I knew it! I always knew she liked him! Y'know, she&#146;d say
no, but here we are! Right? We just broke up, first thing she does!</p>

<p>Chandler: You didn&#146;t just break up.</p>

<p>Ross: Hey, it&#146;s been like three weeks!</p>

<p>Chandler: You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I
mean bullets have left guns slower!</p>

<p>Ross: Here they come, here they come. Oh-ho, if she kisses him goodnight,
I&#146;m gonna kill myself, I swear. I can&#146;t, I can&#146;t watch this. (turns away,
then quickly turns to look again) Come on, date over! Date over! Uh-oh, here we go,
she&#146;s going in.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay.</p>

<p>Ross: She&#146;s going in. Wait! He&#146;s going in! He&#146;s going in!! The
door&#146;s closed! I, I can&#146;t see anything but the door closed!!</p>

<p>Chandler: And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.</p>

<p>Ross: Okay, I have to do something. I mean, I have, I have to stop it!</p>

<p>Chandler: Stop what?!</p>

<p>Ross: I don&#146;t know, but I ah, I have the feeling that my being there will
do it. I&#146;ll go over and I will borrow something. Juice!! I need juice!!</p>

<p>(He starts to exit, but Chandler tries to stop him by climbing on his back and grabbing
hold of the foosball table.)</p>

<p>Chandler: No!! You can&#146;t!! </p>

<p>Ross: Look, they must be stopped!</p>

<p align="left">Chandler: I am your friend, and I am not gonna let you do this!!
(Ross is now dragging Chandler and the foosball table to the door) You are surprisingly
strong!</p>

<p>Ross: I need juice! People need juice!!</p>

<p>Chandler: Look man!</p>

<p>Ross: People need juice!</p>

<p>Chandler: Listen to me!! (Chandler turns him around and closes and holds the
door shut with his feet.) </p>

<p>Ross: Juice, I need...</p>

<p>Chandler: She&#146;s moving on! Okay, if it&#146;s not this guy, it&#146;s gonna
be somebody else! And unless you&#146;re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you
are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man?
It&#146;s over.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, okay. </p>

<p>Chandler: Okay. </p>

<p>Ross: It&#146;s just I miss her so much.</p>

<p>Chandler: I know. (He rubs Ross&#146;s head) </p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is pouring Mark some coffee.]</p>

<p>Mark: Why do all you&#146;re coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh. That&#146;s so Monica can keep track. That way if one on them is
missing, she can be like, &#145;Where&#146;s number 27?!&#146;</p>

<p>(She sits down, and Mark leans over and kisses her. Rachel doesn&#146;t react. He tries
it again, and Rachel jumps back quickly.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Y'know what?</p>

<p>Mark: No. And I don&#146;t think I&#146;m gonna want to.</p>

<p>Rachel: I can&#146;t do this.</p>

<p>Mark: Yep. Yep, that&#146;s what I didn&#146;t want to know.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, oh, Mark, I&#146;m doing this for the wrong reasons, y'know?
I&#146;m just doing it to get back at Ross. I&#146;m sorry, it&#146;s not very fair to
you.</p>

<p>Mark: Ahh! Fair, schmair! Y'know? Look, if you want to get back at Ross, I am
here for you. Really? No-no, I say-I say, I say we get back at him right on this couch.
Right here!</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh God. I&#146;m sorry about this.</p>

<p>Mark: That&#146;s okay.</p>

<p>Rachel: You sure?</p>

<p>Mark: Yeah. I can just go home and get back at him by myself.</p>

<p>[Scene: A Hospital Reception, Monica and Pete are there.]</p>

<p>Spokeswoman: ...has become the penicillin of the twenty-first century. And so
today, this hospital is about to take major steps toward leading that revolution. It is
truly ironic, on one hand consider the size...</p>

<p>Pete: (to Monica) Hey, can I ask you something?</p>

<p>Monica: Sure.</p>

<p>Pete: Where are we? </p>

<p>Monica: (looks around) Well, with all these doctors and nurses, I&#146;m gonna
say, midget rodeo.</p>

<p>Pete: Just tell me the truth.</p>

<p>Monica: Okay. Umm, y'know, I don&#146;t think, I don&#146;t think I told you
this, but umm, I just got out of a really serious relationship.</p>

<p>Pete: Oh, yeah. Wasn&#146;t that like a year ago?</p>

<p>Monica: So I did tell you. Okay, y'know, that really isn&#146;t the thing. Umm,
the thing is that, right now I&#146;m just in a place in my life where I need to focus on
me. Y'know what I mean?</p>

<p>Pete: Oh, yeah. I know that.</p>

<p>Monica: I so wanna be attracted to you.</p>

<p>Pete: But you&#146;re not. Okay, good.</p>

<p>Monica: I&#146;m sorry.</p>

<p>Pete: Y'know what, don&#146;t be. This is not, don&#146;t be, &#145;cause
it&#146;s not so bad.</p>

<p>Monica: It&#146;s not?</p>

<p align="left">Pete: I know I&#146;m no John Bon Jovi, (Monica laughs) or someone
who find attractive, I&#146;m just, I think, y'know, that you might end up feeling
differently.</p>

<p>Monica: Well, um, look I-I don&#146;t want this to come our wrong, but ah, you
seem awfully confident for a guy I just told I wasn&#146;t attracted too.</p>

<p>Pete: Yeah, stupidly charming isn&#146;t&#146; it? Well listen let&#146;s, you
wanna get something to eat? &#145;Cause this place is kinda depressing. (they start
to leave)</p>

<p>Spokeswoman: And the man who made all this possible... Mr. Peter Becker.</p>

<p>Pete: (to Monica) One second.</p>

<p>(He takes the scissors, cuts the ribbon, shakes her hand, posses for the picture, and
leaves.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is sitting in one of the black chairs, and turns
to face the other one.]</p>

<p>Chandler: I don&#146;t think this town is big enough for both of us to relax in.
(He blows on his hand) Draw!! (He quickly pulls the lever to raise the foot rest, like a
gunfighter in a Western.) </p>

<p>(Joey enters.)</p>

<p>Chandler: (to Joey) I wasn&#146;t doing anything. (Joey starts angrily throwing
his stuff down.) Uh-oh, what did she do now?</p>

<p>Joey: Just because she went to Yale drama, she thinks she&#146;s like the
greatest actress since, since, sliced bread!</p>

<p>Chandler: Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.</p>

<p>Joey: God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, &#145;Oh, I&#146;m so
talented.&#146; and &#145;Oh, I&#146;m so pretty,&#146; and &#145;Ooh, I smell so
good.&#146;</p>

<p>Chandler: I think somebody has a crush on somebody.</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?</p>

<p>Chandler: I&#146;m talking about you. You big, big freak.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh. (realises) Ohh. Ohh, you&#146;re out of your mind.</p>

<p>Chandler: Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you
were in a school yard you&#146;d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, yeah?! Then how come I keep thinking about her in all these sexual
scenarios and stuff huh?!</p>

<p>[Scene: The Theatre, Kate and Joey are rehearsing the same scene as before.] </p>

<p>Kate: Happy?! Is that what I&#146;m supposed to be Vic? Happy?</p>

<p>Joey: Well, why don&#146;t you tell me what you&#146;re supposed to be! Huh?
Because I sure as hell can&#146;t figure it out! I talk to you and it&#146;s nothin&#146;.
You look at me, and nothin&#146;. (He kisses her, more passionately this time) Nothing.</p>

<p>The Director: You guys make me fly! High! Okay, we&#146;re gonna pick it up
here, tomorrow.</p>

<p>Kate: Well, that was ah...</p>

<p>Joey: Better?</p>

<p>Kate: Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G&#146;night.</p>

<p>Joey: Ah, Kate? </p>

<p>Kate: Yeah?</p>

<p>Joey: You ah, you forgot your shoes.</p>

<p>Kate: (she giggles) I&#146;m probably gonna need those. Huh? (she giggles some
more)</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, listen you ah....</p>

<p>Kate: Hmm?</p>

<p>Joey: ...feel like getting a cup of coffee?</p>

<p>Kate: Umm.</p>

<p>The Director: (leaning in) Kate?</p>

<p>Kate: Yep.</p>

<p>The Director: You ready to go?</p>

<p>Kate: Yeah.</p>

<p>The Director: (to Joey) Very nice. Very nice. (he walks away)</p>

<p>Kate: So umm, I&#146;ll see you tomorrow, huh?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, yeah sure, goodnight.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is in the kitchen chopping vegetables. Chandler and
Phoebe are sitting in the living room.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: (to Chandler) Hey! (Chandler looks up, startled) Why isn&#146;t it
Spiderman? Y&#146;know like Goldman, Silverman...</p>

<p>Chandler: &#145;Cause it&#146;s-it&#146;s not his last name.</p>

<p>Phoebe: It isn&#146;t?</p>

<p>Chandler: No, it&#146;s not like, like Phil Spiderman. He&#146;s a spider, man.
Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but there&#146;s no Gold Man.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh, okay. There should be Gold Man!</p>

<p>Rachel: (entering) Hey!</p>

<p>Monica: Hey, Rach, how was work?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn&#146;t a chair.</p>

<p>Monica: By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I&#146;m just gonna throw it
