<p class="scene">[Scene: Monica's apartment]</p> 
<p>Joey: (enters the room) Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?</p>
<p>Chandler: (browsing through a diary) Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.</p>
<p>Joey: Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.</p>
<p>Chandler: I could fall asleep at a play.</p>
<p>Phoebe: What is it?</p>
<p>Joey: It's a one-woman play called &quot;Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life&quot;.</p>
<p>Monica: It sounds interesting!</p>
<p>Ross: Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett... (Ross starts snoring, faking to fall asleep)</p>
<p>Phoebe: I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?</p>
<p>Joey: You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!</p>
<p>Ross: What? How come that you don't have to go!</p>
<p>Joey: I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.</p>
<p>Chandler: (browsing through a diary) Uh, let's see, who do I hate?</p>
<p>Rachel: (gets up from the sofa and moves to the kitchen but Joey blocks her way) Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.</p>
<p>Joey: (lifts Rachel up and moves her behind him so she can walk on) Hey, here you go.</p>
<p>Rachel: Ooh... oooh... (pause) (Rachel is all bah-jiggity about Joey) oh, ah... (pause) (to Monica) Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p>Monica: Yeah.</p>
<p>Rachel: Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?</p>
<p>Monica: No, I don't think it ever works. Why?</p>
<p>Rachel: No reason.</p>
<p>Monica: No, no, Rachel?</p>
<p>Rachel: Yeah</p>
<p>Monica: Who do you wanna fool around with?</p>
<p>Rachel: (with high pitched voice) Nobody, forget it!</p>
<p>(Monica points at Joey, Rachel turns and sees him)<p>Rachel: (giggling and whispering) Maybe.</p>
<p>Monica: (whispering) You can't!</p>
<p>Rachel: (whispering) Why? (Monica gesticulates mumbling something that starts with &quot;because&quot;) Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.</p>
<p>Monica: In the hall.</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: In the hall]</p> 
<p>Monica: You wanna fool around with Joey?</p>
<p>Rachel: Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!</p>
<p>Monica: Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?</p>
<p>Rachel: Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.</p>
<p>Monica: Who, who are they?</p>
<p>Rachel: I know them from work.</p>
<p>Monica: Both of them?</p>
<p>Rachel: No, one of them...</p>
<p>Monica: Which one?</p>
<p>Rachel: I don't know, what were the names I just said?</p>
<p>Monica: Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.</p>
<p>Rachel: All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we (Joey enters the hall) Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion? (Joey enters his apartment)</p>
<p>Monica: What the hell are you cooking!</p>
<p class="center">Opening credits</p><p class="scene">[Scene: Central Perk, Ross enters]</p> 
<p>Ross: Hey!</p>
<p>Monica: Hey!</p>
<p>Chandler: Hey!</p>
<p>Ross: Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.</p>
<p>Chandler: Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Ross: (covering with his hand Chandler's face, like pretending he's not there) (to Monica) There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.</p>
<p>Monica: What's so bad about that?</p>
<p>Ross: It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.</p>
<p>Monica: (fingering her elbow): Ross?</p>
<p>Ross: (looking his elbow, where there's a patch) These aren't suede.</p>
<p>(a woman walks in)<p>Charlie: (to Gunther) Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?</p>
<p>Gunther: No.</p>
<p>Ross: Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.</p>
<p>Charlie: Oh, hi. I'm professor Wealer.</p>
<p>Ross: Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.</p>
<p>Charlie: It's a... It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.</p>
<p>Ross: Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.</p>
<p>Monica: (to Chandler) Is he gonna introduce us?</p>
<p>Chandler: (to Monica) No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.</p>
<p>Charlie: And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.</p>
<p>Ross: Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.</p>
<p>Monica: (to chandler) Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.</p>
<p>Ross: (hitting Monica with his suitcase) (to Charlie) We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.</p>
<p>Charlie: Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?</p>
<p>Ross: I don't think so.</p>
<p>Charlie: I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?</p>
<p>Ross: Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is &quot;if you can't come on time, then don't come at all&quot;. (pause) An option that many of my students use. (pause) Shall we?</p>
<p>Charlie: You don't think we should wait for him?</p>
<p>Ross: You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?</p>
<p>Professor Spafford: Professor Geller?</p>
<p>Ross: Oh, damn it!</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: Joey's apartment]</p> 
<p>(Rachel enters the room and checks the answering machine)<p>Jane: (from the answering machine) Hi Joey it's Jane Rogers, can't wait for your party tonight. Listen, I forgot your address, can you give me a call? Thanks, bye.</p>
<p>Joey: (entering the room) Hey!</p>
<p>Rachel: Hey!</p>
<p>Joey: What's happenin'?</p>
<p>Rachel: Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.</p>
<p>Joey: Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... (she plays the answering machine)</p>
<p>Message: &quot;Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight&quot; (Joey's upset and stops it)</p>
<p>Joey: (yelling) Stupid Jane Rogers!!</p>
<p>Rachel: (angry) You are having a party tonight??</p>
<p>Joey: Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.</p>
<p>Rachel: And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?</p>
<p>Joey: I do it every year.</p>
<p>Rachel: You do that every year??</p>
<p>Joey: I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??</p>
<p>Joey: Yeah...</p>
<p>Rachel: And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?</p>
<p>Joey: Yeah...</p>
<p>Rachel: OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?</p>
<p>Joey: (Smiling) I can't believe you guys went for that one!</p>
<p>Rachel: Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?</p>
<p>Joey: You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!</p>
<p>Rachel: Well, then so you just invite me...!</p>
<p>Joey: (speaking aloud) Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...</p>
<p>Joey: Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.</p>
<p>Rachel: (yelling and jumping like a child) OH, a soap opera roof party!! I'm going to a soap opera roof party!! Oh my God, oh my God!! (realizing how she's behaving) And it's out of my system!</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: Ross, Charlie and Professor Spafford are sitting at the table in a restaurant]</p> 
<p>Professor Spafford: (speaking very slowly) And then my wife and I went on a cruise to the Galapagos. There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.</p>
<p>Ross: (very bored, he tries to avoid the conversation speaking to Charlie) So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?</p>
<p>Professor Spafford: And that's not all I'm allergic to.</p>
<p>Ross: (to Charlie) Oh, it's not over!</p>
<p>Professor Spafford: I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...</p>
<p>Ross: So basically all nuts?</p>
<p>Professor Spafford: Interestingly... no.</p>
<p>Charlie: Kinda playing fast and loose with the word &quot;interesting&quot;.</p>
<p>Professor Spafford: If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom. (he goes away)</p>
<p>Charlie: Oh my God!!</p>
<p>Ross: I've lost the will to live.</p>
<p>Charlie: Let's ditch him!</p>
<p>Ross: What?</p>
<p>Charlie: Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!</p>
<p>Ross: Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm... (aping Professor Spafford) When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...</p>
<p>Charlie: Stop it, stop it! He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!! (they run outside)</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment]</p> 
<p>Ross: (entering with Charlie) Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.</p>
<p>Phoebe: Hi!</p>
<p>Ross: Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.</p>
<p>Phoebe: Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too! (pause) Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?</p>
<p>Charlie: Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...</p>
<p>Phoebe: Ah, ah.</p>
<p>Charlie: (her mobile phone rings) Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. (she cuts herself off for a moment)</p>
<p>Ross: (to Phoebe) Ranion's theory of species variegation?</p>
<p>Phoebe: Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!</p>
<p>Monica: (to Ross) So, did you two have fun?</p>
<p>Ross: Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...</p>
<p>Monica: And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a (aloud) HOTTY!! (Charlie looks at her) HI!</p>
<p>Rachel: (she enters wearing a bath-robe) Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.</p>
<p>Ross: Really? Wh-what's wrong?</p>
<p>Rachel: I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!</p>
<p>Charlie: Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.</p>
<p>Rachel: ... Ok, who is this?</p>
<p>Ross: I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!</p>
<p>Monica: Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?</p>
<p>Rachel: Sure! (Monica takes her apart) Oh...</p>
<p>Monica: You're not sick!</p>
<p>Rachel: What? Yes, I am!</p>
<p>Monica: Ok, then, why are you... (she opens her robe revealing a nice black dress) all dressed up??</p>
<p>Rachel: When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! (she closes her robe)</p>
<p>Monica: You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!</p>
<p>Monica: Ok, what is this?</p>
<p>Rachel: Ok! (whispering) Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!</p>
<p>Monica: (aloud) WHAT?</p>
<p>Ross: (looking at them) Wh-what's going on?</p>
<p>Monica: Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!</p>
<p>Rachel: And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!</p>
<p>Charlie: I thought you came to say you were sick.</p>
<p>Rachel: Ok professor or detective?</p>
<p>Phoebe: Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?</p>
<p>Rachel: Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!</p>
<p>Phoebe: And that horrible museum tour!</p>
<p>Ross: No, I arranged that...</p>
<p>(Joey enters, wearing a bathrobe)<p>Joey: (sounds tired) Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.</p>
<p>Phoebe: We know about your party Joey.</p>
<p>Joey: What party?</p>
<p>Monica: The game's over! Take off your robe!</p>
<p>Joey: (looks perplexed and opens up his robe) Ok... I mean...</p>
<p>Everyone: No!! Cover it up!!</p>
<p>Joey: (to Charlie after covering himself up again) Nice to meet ya! (Charlie waves hesitantly and Joey leaves)</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: The Roof]</p> 
<p>Joey: (To some people) Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it (Shakes a man's hand) Thanks for coming.</p>
<p>Monica: Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!</p>
<p>Kyle Lowder: (to Monica) Hi. (walks on)</p>
<p>Monica: (Yells after him) I love you!</p>
<p>Joey: Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...</p>
<p>Monica: Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.</p>
<p>Phoebe: Hey!</p>
<p>Monica: (Excited) Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.</p>
<p>Phoebe: Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? (Looks around)</p>
<p>Monica: (Shocked) Oh my God! Chandler!</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: The theater. Chandler is sitting in the otherwise empty front row, looking around nervously]</p> 
<p>Chandler: Where the hell is everybody?</p>
<p>(The lights dim and Chandler tries to get away but as the bitter lady comes on stage and starts yelling he promptly changes his mind and sits down)<p>Bitter lady: (yelling) Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: The Roof, Rachel is talking to a guy who hands her a tissue with something written on it]</p> 
<p>Monica: (to Rachel) Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this &quot;best wishes&quot; crap. I want &quot;love&quot;.</p>
<p>Rachel: Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.</p>
<p>Monica: Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!</p>
<p>Matthew Ashford: It was nice to meet you Rachel.</p>
<p>Rachel: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>Matthew Ashford: Call me.</p>
<p>Rachel: Ok</p>
<p>(Matthew leaves)<p>Monica: (yelling after him) We will!!</p>
<p>Monica: (to Rachel) Look at you with all the guys!</p>
<p>Rachel: Yeah!</p>
<p>Monica: I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?</p>
<p>Rachel: Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!</p>
<p>Monica: Please... Chandler is the love of my life... (At which point a man in leather pants walks by)... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! (Follows the man in the leather)</p>
<p>(cut to Ross and Charlie)<p>Ross: (to Charlie) So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?</p>
<p>Charlie: Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.</p>
<p>Ross: Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?</p>
<p>Charlie: Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.</p>
<p>Ross: You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?</p>
<p>Charlie: Yeah...</p>
<p>Ross: ... And you called him Alby!? (laughs) I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...</p>
<p>Charlie: Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.</p>
<p>Ross: Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!</p>
<p>Charlie: Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...</p>
<p>Ross: (very interested) Oh! like what?! (Charlie looks at him confused, but smiling) Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;.</p>
<p>Charlie: Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.</p>
<p>Ross: Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?</p>
<p>Charlie: A guy who won two.</p>
<p>Ross: (a little suprised) Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart</p>
<p>Charlie: Yeah... for three years.</p>
<p>Ross: Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?</p>
<p>Charlie: (smiling and thinks for a moment)... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.</p>
<p>Ross: Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?</p>
<p>Charlie: No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.</p>
<p>Ross: Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? (takes the half-full glasses and goes to the counter)</p>
<p>Phoebe: Hey Ross!</p>
<p>Rache: How is it going with Charlie?</p>
<p>Ross: (sarcastically) Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.</p>
<p>Phoebe: Oh, What's the matter?</p>
<p>Ross: She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.</p>
<p>Rachel: I always loved that!!</p>
<p>Ross: Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! (Rachel nods) Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!</p>
<p>Phoebe: Worse?</p>
<p>Ross: Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... (gestures with his hands and says in an impression voice?) &quot;Can we walk&quot;? (Phoebe starts laughing) Oh, you... you like that?</p>
<p>Phoebe: (still laughing) No. (points to Rachel who stuck two straws in her mouth to look like a mammoth's tusks)</p>
<p>Ross: What? (turns around to look at Rachel)</p>
<p>Rachel: Come on! I think this is funny! (Ross leaves)</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: Chandler in the theater]</p> 
<p>Bitter lady: Well, I bet you are all thinkin' &quot;Now would be a really great time for an intermission&quot;, huh?</p>
<p>Chandler: (To himself) oh yes, God yes!!</p>
<p>Bitter lady: (now yelling) Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word. (Now standing right in front of Chandler and bending down almost to his level as if speaking to him, yelling even louder) How could he leave me?!?!</p>
<p>Chandler: I... I don't know... you seem lovely.</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: The roof, Joey is walking towards Ross with a guy]</p> 
<p>Joey: Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk. (To Dirk) Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. (Ross and Dirk shake hands)</p>
<p>Ross: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>Dirk: Hey! So what show are you on?</p>
<p>Ross: Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.</p>
<p>(Dirk is confused)<p>Joey: It's a science.</p>
<p>Dirk: Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on &quot;Days&quot;. And my character has just won the Nobel prize.</p>
<p>(Ross looks annoyed hearing that even Dirk's character won a Nobel prize)<p>Joey: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...</p>
<p>Ross: Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.</p>
<p>Dirk: Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.</p>
<p>Ross: I'd lead with that.</p>
<p>(Cut to Monica holding up her shirt, revealing her bra. An actor stands beside her, holding a pen in his hand.)<p>Monica: That's it, just sign right on the bra (the actor does so).</p>
<p>Joey: Monica!</p>
<p>Monica: Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!</p>
<p>(Joey, resigned, walks to Rachel's table)<p>Joey: (To Rachel) What have you got there?</p>
<p>Ross: Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.</p>
<p>Joey: Ah, let me see! (she hands him a pile of tissues) Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?</p>
<p>Rachel: (drunken voice) I think I am.</p>
<p>Joey: (browsing the tissues) Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug (discards one). This guy's Canadian (discards another). And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.</p>
<p>(Rachel is puzzled)<p>Joey: (discarding all the remaining tissues one by one) Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...</p>
<p>Rachel: (picking up the tissues) Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?</p>
<p>Joey: Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.</p>
<p>Rachel: Joey, you're so sweet.</p>
<p>Joey: That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.</p>
<p>Rachel: Who (looks around)?</p>
<p>(Joey motions for Rachel to lean in. She does so.)<p>Joey: Me.</p>
<p>Rachel: (surprised) What? (with a nervous smile) Really?</p>
<p>Joey: Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! (they high-five)</p>
<p>Joey: Gotcha.</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh, Very funny... Joey.</p>
<p>(Joey leaves. Rachel gulps down what's left of her drink and grimaces.)<p>(Chandler walks in)<p>Chandler: (to Monica) So, how did you enjoy the play?</p>
<p>Monica: Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.</p>
<p>Chandler: Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.</p>
<p>Monica: You really liked it?</p>
<p>Chandler: Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained (bitter woman's tone) not to listen! (pause) But after chapter 16: &quot;fat, single and ready to mingle&quot;, I was uplifted.</p>
<p>Monica: Oh really!</p>
<p>Chandler: Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!</p>
<p>Monica: No!</p>
<p>Chandler: Did somebody sign your bra?</p>
<p>Monica: So I got it when I was 13...</p>
<p class="scene">[Scene: At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.]</p> 
<p>Phoebe: Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?</p>
<p>Ross: It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.</p>
<p>Phoebe: Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, 
slum it with some average Joe Phd.</p>
<p>Ross: Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.</p>
<p>Phoebe: You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...</p>
<p>Ross: And sexy.</p>
<p>Phoebe: Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!</p>
<p>Ross: Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.</p>
<p>Phoebe: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!</p>
<p>Ross: Stop going through my stuff (walks away)!</p>
<p>(Rachel approaches Monica)<p>Rachel: (to Monica) Hey!</p>
<p>Monica: Hey!</p>
<p>Rachel: I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.</p>
<p>Monica: No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.</p>
<p>Rachel: Please, what about you and Chandler?</p>
<p>Monica: That's different! I was drunk and stupid!</p>
<p>Rachel: Well hello (points to herself)!</p>
<p>Monica: What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?</p>
<p>Rachel: I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!</p>
<p>Monica: Alright (shrugs). I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.</p>
<p>Rachel: (pause) I'm gonna do it.</p>
<p>Monica: And I can't stop you.</p>
<p>Rachel: No.</p>
<p>(Rachel goes look for Joey. She sees him and Charlie kissing passionately.)<p>Ross: (to Rachel) Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?</p>
<p>(Rachel just stands there staring at Joey and Charlie in silence. After a while, Ross turns around and sees them.)<p>Ross: I'm smarter than him!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.</p>
<p>Chandler: Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.</p>
<p>Monica: Oh, you're so wonderful.</p>
<p>Bitter woman: Why don't you like me! Chapter one: my first period.</p>
<p>Chandler: Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death (runs away).</p>
