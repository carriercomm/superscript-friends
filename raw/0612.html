<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Phoebe, Rachel and Monica are there. Ross walks in with
a magazine in his hand.]</p>

<p>Ross: Hey, you&#146;re not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it
in to <i>Playboy</i>. They printed it!</p>

<p>Phoebe: I didn&#146;t know <i>Playboy</i> prints jokes.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. It&#146;s not
just about the pictures.</p>

<p>Monica: That didn&#146;t work on mom, it&#146;s not going to work on us.</p>

<p><strong>Ross:</strong> (showing them the page) Here, check it out. It&#146;s the first
one, too.</p>

<p>(They all laugh indifferently, except Chandler, who&#146;s a little angry.)</p>

<p>Chandler: That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.</p>

<p>Ross: What?</p>

<p>Chandler: I made that joke up.</p>

<p>Ross: Uh, oh-oh, no you didn&#146;t. I did.</p>

<p>Chandler: Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest
joke he&#146;d ever heard.</p>

<p>Ross: Hey, tell Dan, &#145;Thanks.&#146;</p>

<p>(Rachel is looking at the magazine and laughing.)</p>

<p>Ross: What?</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is
funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?</p>

<p>Monica: No.</p>

<p>Chandler: Seriously?</p>

<p>Monica: Well, you tell a lot of jokes!</p>

<p>Ross: Look, Chandler, it&#146;s my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any
better they don&#146;t print the name, so it doesn&#146;t really matter who gets credit,
right?</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah, I guess.</p>

<p>Joey: (entering) Hey guys.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey, <i>Playboy</i>
printed my joke.</p>

<p>Ross: No, it&#146;s my joke, it&#146;s mine. You can call them, they&#146;ll
tell you.</p>

<p>Chandler: It&#146;s my joke.</p>

<p>Ross: It&#146;s my joke.</p>

<p>Joey: Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there,
right?</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Joey&#146;s apartment, Joey is sitting at the counter as Chandler enters.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Dude, you have got to turn on <i>Behind the Music</i>. The band Heart
is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.</p>

<p>Joey: Let&#146;s go watch it at your place.</p>

<p>Chandler: Nah, Monica&#146;s watching some cooking show. Come on, I don&#146;t
want to miss when they were skinny.</p>

<p>Joey: Chandler, Chandler, y&#146;know what we should do? You and I should go out
and get some new sunglasses.</p>

<p>Chandler: What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the
screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?</p>

<p>Joey: No, that&#146;s <i>VH-1</i>. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen
to today . . . It&#146;s like a lotta noise to me. I don&#146;t know&#133;</p>

<p>Chandler: Joey, why is your cable out?</p>

<p>Joey: I uh, oh! Because, uh, I haven&#146;t really paid the bill</p>

<p>Chandler: If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some
money?</p>

<p>Joey: No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a
little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot. </p>

<p>Chandler: Whoa ho.</p>

<p>Joey: I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to
the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the <i>Playboy</i> magazine).</p>

<p>Chandler: (picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealer
will let us watch the show at his place?</p>

<p>Joey: Sure.</p>

<p>Chandler: (with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone
bill?</p>

<p>Joey: Not so much.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Rachel are on the couch looking at the <i>Playboy</i>
magazine. When they hear someone coming, Monica goes to hide it under the sofa cushions.] </p>

<p>Phoebe: (entering) Hey.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (relieved) It&#146;s only you.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Wh-wh-what are you doing?</p>

<p>Rachel: We are looking at a <i>Playboy</i>.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh, I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a
picture). Yikes!</p>

<p>Monica: So do you think that these pictures&#151;Are, are they trying to tell a
story?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has
lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, she&#146;s crying out, &#145;Where are
they, where are they?&#146;</p>

<p>Monica: Well, she&#146;s not going to find them lying in the grass like that.</p>

<p>(They flip through the pages to another picture.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn,
lift up your shirt, and bend over?</p>


<p>Rachel and Monica: Yeah.</p>

<p>Rachel: You see, now, I would date this girl. She&#146;s cute, she&#146;s
outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, that&#146;s got to come in
handy</p>

<p>Monica: Okay, I&#146;ve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date,
who would it be?</p>

<p>Rachel: (thinks) I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p>Monica: Me neither.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Rachel.</p>

<p>Monica: What?!</p>

<p>Phoebe: I don&#146;t know. (Pause) Me neither.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, and Ross are sitting on the couch.]</p>

<p>Joey: You forget how many great songs Heart had.</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah.</p>

<p>Ross: You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.</p>

<p>Chandler: So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but
I&#146;m not even sure I got it.</p>

<p>Ross: What, you didn&#146;t get it? The doctor is a monkey.</p>

<p>(He and Chandler crack up.)</p>

<p>Chandler: And monkeys can&#146;t write out prescriptions.</p>

<p>(He and Ross crack up again. Joey just sits there)</p>

<p>Chandler: (stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.</p>

<p>Ross: Your joke? Well, I think &#145;the Hef&#146; would disagree, which is why
he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.</p>

<p>Chandler: So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.</p>

<p>Ross: Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think I&#146;ll show
the sexy teller that I am a published writer.</p>

<p>Chandler: Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah!</p>

<p>Ross: Well, I&#146;m not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay (he goes to sit down).</p>

<p>(Ross leaps out of his chair and runs out the door, with Chandler in hot pursuit.)</p>

<p>Gunther: (handing Joey the bill) Here you go.</p>

<p>Joey: Ah, Gunther, I can&#146;t pay for this right now because I&#146;m not
working, so I&#146;ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payin&#146; for stuff.</p>

<p>Gunther: Well, if you want, you can work here.</p>

<p>Joey: Uh, I don&#146;t know. Ya see, it&#146;s just, see I was a regular on a
soap opera y&#146;know? And to go from that to this, I just&#133; Plus, I&#146;d have to
wait on all my friends.</p>

<p>Gunther: Okay, but the money&#146;s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as
much as you want.</p>

<p>Joey: What?!</p>

<p>Gunther: Flexible hours.</p>

<p>Joey: Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler&#146;s bedroom, they are in bed together.]</p>

<p>Monica: (visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it,
but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.</p>

<p><strong>Chandler:</strong> (visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it. </p>

<p>Monica: It&#146;s wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.</p>

<p>Chandler: You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross
did? He stole my joke. You know what? I&#146;m going to get a joke journal. Y&#146;know?
And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.</p>

<p>Monica: That&#146;s a good idea. </p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah!</p>

<p>Monica: Do you know what&#146;s a bad idea?</p>

<p>Chandler: Picking Rachel.</p>

<p>Monica: That&#146;s right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear
something?</p>

<p>Chandler: Maybe it&#146;s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing
my thoughts.</p>

<p>Monica: It&#146;s coming from the living room.</p>

<p>(They go out to investigate, and find Joey wrapped in a blanket watching their
television.)</p>

<p>Joey: (sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back
to bed.)</p>

<p>[Scene, Phoebe and Rachel&#146;s, they&#146;re sitting together on the couch.]</p>

<p>Monica: (entering) Hey, you guys.</p>


<p>Phoebe and Rachel: Hey.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (laughing) Oh, don&#146;t you guys look cute. You guys make
such a cute couple.</p>

<p>Rachel: Monica, what are you doing?</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (laughing harder) Nothing, I&#146;m just trying to recreate
some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when you
picked Rachel over me? That was funny.</p>

<p>Phoebe: I guess it was kinda funny.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (angrily) It wasn&#146;t funny at all! Why would you do that?
Why didn&#146;t you pick me?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than
you is just that you&#146;re &#133; just &#133; kinda high maintenance&#151;Okay
let&#146;s go to lunch!</p>

<p>Monica: That is completely untrue. You think I&#146;m high maintenance? Okay,
prove it. I want you to make a list and we&#146;re going to go through it point by point!</p>

<p>Phoebe: No, okay, you&#146;re right. You&#146;re easy-going. You&#146;re just
not as easy-going as Rachel. She&#146;s just more flexible and-and mellow. That&#146;s
all.</p>

<p>Rachel: (To Monica) Well, people are different.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Ya, you know, Rachel &#133; she&#146;ll do whatever you want.
Y&#146;know, you can just walk all over her.</p>

<p>Rachel: What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that I&#146;m a pushover?
I&#146;m not a pushover.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh, okay, (laughing) you&#146;re not a pushover.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh my &#133; you think I&#146;m a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you
know what? You&#146;re not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think
that&#146;s pretty strong, that&#146;s what I think. Come on, Monica, let&#146;s go to
lunch. (She leaves)</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> (to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her
coat and leaves, too.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the hallway.]</p>

<p>Rachel: I cannot believe her.</p>

<p>Monica: I know. Where do you wanna go eat?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.</p>

<p>Monica: I&#146;m sick of Japanese. We&#146;re not going there.</p>

<p>Rachel: All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.</p>

<p>Monica: All right.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler are there as Ross enters and sees
Gunther.]</p>

<p>Ross: (showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check this
out.</p>

<p>(Gunther looks at the joke and laughs.)</p>

<p>Gunther: Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up. </p>

<p>(Ross begins to say something, realizes what Gunther just said, turns, and glares at
Chandler. Chandler just shrugs it off.)</p>

<p>Joey: Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, &#145;cause I&#146;m heading
up there.</p>

<p>Ross: Uh, yeah, I&#146;ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.</p>

<p>Joey: Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? &#145;Cause I&#146;m going up there. </p>

<p>Rachel: No.</p>

<p>Monica: No, thank you.</p>

<p>Joey: (to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, &#145;cause I&#146;m
heading up there. </p>

<p>Woman: I&#146;d love an ice water.</p>

<p>Joey: You got it.</p>

<p>Monica: Joey, what are you doing?</p>

<p>Joey: Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a &#145;what&#146;s wrong with
you?&#146; look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Joey, honey, I don&#146;t think you&#146;re supposed to go back there.</p>

<p>Joey: Nah, it&#146;s okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if they&#146;re in
on a secret together.)</p>

<p>Gunther: Don&#146;t wink at me. And put on your apron.</p>

<p>Joey: Okay, but I don&#146;t see you asking any other paying customers to put on
aprons. </p>

<p>Monica: Joey, do you work here?</p>

<p>Joey: No.</p>

<p>Customer: Hey, waiter.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah?</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p>Monica: Joey, what&#146;s going on. What didn&#146;t you tell us you work here?</p>

<p>Joey: It&#146;s kind of embarrassing, y&#146;know. I mean, I was an actor and
now I&#146;m a waiter. It&#146;s supposed to go in the other direction.</p>

<p>Chandler: So is your apron. You&#146;re wearing it like a cape.</p>

<p>Joey: I mean, the job&#146;s easy and the money&#146;s good, you know? I guess
I&#146;m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I
just feel kind of weird serving you guys.</p>

<p>Rachel: Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?</p>

<p>Joey: Okay, I guess it doesn&#146;t seem that weird.</p>

<p>Ross: Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven&#146;t gotten it.</p>

<p>Joey: See, now it&#146;s weird again.</p>

<p>Chandler: I think it&#146;s great that you work here. You&#146;re going to make
a lot of money, and here&#146;s your first tip: Don&#146;t eat yellow snow. (He laughs,
then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15,
coffeehouse.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass
on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the
coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long
way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.</p>

<p>Joey: Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y&#146;know? Now, how
about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It&#146;s all about turnover.</p>

<p>Ross: Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, I&#146;m sorry, Ross. I&#146;ll get it for you right now. And since I
made you wait, I&#146;ll toss in a free muffin.</p>

<p>(He looks at Rachel and winks, she gives him the thumbs-up sign.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel&#146;s, Phoebe is sitting on the couch as Rachel and Monica
enter.]</p>

<p>Rachel: Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay.</p>

<p>Monica: So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little
bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.</p>

<p>Monica: Hah!</p>

<p>Phoebe: That true, I am flaky.</p>

<p>Rachel: So, what, you&#146;re just, you&#146;re just okay with being flaky?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, totally.</p>

<p>Monica: Well, then, I&#146;m okay with being high maintenance.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.</p>

<p>Phoebe: That&#146;s great. Good for you guys.</p>

<p>Monica: I am not high maintenance!</p>

<p>Rachel: I am not a pushover!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Who said you were?</p>


<p>Monica and Rachel: You did!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh, I&#146;m flaky. I&#146;ll say anything.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is coming back from using the phone.]</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.</p>

<p>Gunther: No, I&#146;m leaving to get my hair dyed.</p>

<p>Joey: Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, it&#146;s a great part.
Look, check it out. I&#146;m the lead guy&#146;s best friend and I wait for him in this
bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. &#145;I&#146;m sorry, that seat&#146;s saved.&#146;</p>

<p>Gunther: That&#146;s the whole part?</p>


<p>Joey: Okay, maybe he&#146;s not his best friend, but &#133;</p>

<p>Gunther: Okay, I&#146;ll see you in an hour.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, man, I could totally get that part. &#145;I&#146;m sorry, that seat is
taken.&#146;</p>

<p>Patron: Oh, excuse me.</p>

<p>Joey: No, no, I didn&#146;t mean you. But, you believed me, huh?</p>

<p>Patron: I believed you were saving this seat for someone.</p>

<p>Joey: So, you&#146;d hire me, right?</p>

<p>Patron: For what?</p>

<p>Joey: Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be
closed for about an hour. </p>

<p><strong>Customers:</strong> Huh? What?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, it&#146;s for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. It&#146;s a very
important issue in this month&#146;s <i>Playboy</i>. I&#146;m sure you all read about it.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Ross are both pouting and sitting on the
couch.]</p>

<p>Ross: It&#146;s my joke.</p>

<p>Chandler: It&#146;s my joke.</p>


<p>Ross and Chandler: It&#146;s my joke.</p>

<p>Ross: Y&#146;know, I don&#146;t think we&#146;re going to settle this.</p>

<p>Chandler: Let&#146;s have Monica decide.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah!</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah!</p>

<p>Ross: Hey Mon.</p>

<p>Chandler: Mon, get out here!</p>

<p>Ross: Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.</p>

<p>Monica: Why do I have to decide?</p>

<p>Chandler: Because you&#146;re the only one that can be fair.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah.</p>

<p>Monica: I can&#146;t be fair. You&#146;re my boyfriend.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, but I&#146;m your brother. We&#146;re family. That&#146;s the most
important thing in the world.</p>

<p>Chandler: (to Ross) Don&#146;t try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) I&#146;m
your only chance to have a baby. Okay, let&#146;s go.</p>

<p>Ross: We&#146;ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide
which one of us is telling the truth&#151;me. </p>

<p>Monica: Okay, Chandler, you go first.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.</p>

<p>Monica: Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?</p>

<p>Chandler: Can I finish my story?!</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> Do you want me to pick you?!</p>

<p>Ross: See, I would never snap at you like that.</p>

<p>(Chandler motions to Monica that he&#146;ll give her two babies.)</p>

<p>Monica: Continue.</p>

<p>Chandler: So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve&#146;s
doctor&#146;s name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, &#145;Doctor Monkey?&#146; And that is how
the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his
point.)</p>

<p>Ross: Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution?
Monkey into man? Plus, I&#146;m a doctor, and I had a monkey. I&#146;m Doctor Monkey!</p>

<p>Chandler: I&#146;m not arguing with that.</p>

<p>Monica: All right, I&#146;ve heard enough. I&#146;ve made my decision.</p>

<p>(Both Chandler and Ross are eager to hear her decision.) </p>

<p>Monica: You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it&#146;s offensive to
women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn&#146;t be arguing over who gets credit, you
should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world!
Now let it go! The joke sucks! </p>

<p>(Monica leaves the room)</p>

<p>Ross: It&#146;s your joke.</p>

<p>Chandler: Is not.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is sitting at a table and Phoebe is on the couch. Chandler
and Monica can be seen outside, she&#146;s lecturing him, and pushes him inside. He then
nods to Rachel, and is obviously counting off the seconds in his head and then Monica
makes a grand enterance.]</p>

<p>Monica: Hi, Chandler. There you are.</p>

<p>Chandler: Hi, oh hi.</p>

<p>Monica: Hey, it&#146;s Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don&#146;t you tell them what
you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?</p>

<p>(Rachel and Phoebe exchange looks.)</p>

<p>Chandler: (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient,
together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be
perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and&#151;(He falters and
Monica prompts him.)&#151;generosity of spirit.</p>

<p>Rachel: Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I&#146;ve ever
heard.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Really? I&#146;ve heard better.</p>

<p>Monica: Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.</p>

<p>Chandler: (To Chandler) I&#146;m out of words. Should I just say the whole thing
again?</p>

<p>Monica: Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!</p>

<p>Chandler: (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) You&#146;re a little
high maintenance.</p>

<p>Monica: Ahhh! You are on my list.</p>

<p>Chandler: I&#146;m sorry. You&#146;re not easy-going, but you&#146;re
passionate, and that&#146;s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think
that I&#146;m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that&#146;s good
too. So, they can say that you&#146;re high maintenance, but it&#146;s okay, because I
like &#133; maintaining you.</p>

<p>Monica: (embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didn&#146;t even tell him to say
that. (They hug). All right you&#146;re off my list. </p>

<p>Chandler: (happily) I&#146;m off the list. (Sits on the couch.) </p>

<p>Monica: (sits next to him) Phoebe, it&#146;s okay that you don&#146;t want me to
be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.</p>

<p><strong>Phoebe:</strong> (to Monica) Y&#146;know, suddenly I find you very attractive.</p>

<p>(Joey enters.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Hey, buddy boy, how&#146;d the audition go?</p>

<p>Joey: Not good, no. I didn&#146;t get the part, and I lost my job here, so
&#133;</p>

<p>Phoebe: Wow! That is a bad audition.</p>

<p>Rachel: How-how did you lose your job here?</p>

<p>Joey: Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in
charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.</p>

<p>Rachel: He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left
you in charge when you&#146;ve been working here two days? That&#146;s not, that&#146;s
not right.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, what are ya gonna do?</p>

<p>Rachel: Joey, you can&#146;t let him get away with that. Ya know what, I&#146;m
not going to let him get away with that. I&#146;m going to say something to him&#151;No, I
really shouldn&#146;t say anything&#151;No, I should say something to him. (Goes to the
counter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you
have to fire him&#133;</p>

<p>Gunther: Okay.</p>

<p>Rachel: What?</p>

<p>Gunther: He can have his job back.</p>

<p>Rachel: That&#146;s right, he can have his job back. I&#146;m glad we got that
all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.</p>

<p>Joey: That&#146;s great. Thanks Rach.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who&#146;s a pushover?</p>

<p>Phoebe: (returning from the bathroom) Rach, you&#146;re in my seat.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, I&#146;m sorry. (Gets up and moves.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting at the kitchen
table, talking.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.</p>

<p><strong>Monica:</strong> I pick you, Phoebe.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, well, I kinda thought.</p>

<p>(Phoebe gets up from the table, and while her back is turned, Rachel and Monica
indicate via sign language that they each would have picked the other.)</p>

<p>(Joey, Chandler and Ross enter.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Hey.</p>

<p>Rachel: Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the
other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?</p>

<p>Ross: No way. </p>

<p>Joey: I&#146;m not answering that.</p>

<p>Chandler: Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. I&#146;m not answering
that. </p>
