<p>[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent&#146;s
anniversary party?</p>

<p>Monica: Yeah.</p>

<p>Ross: Sure. Yeah.</p>

<p>Joey: So, who&#146;s the guy?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? (Sits up) Who said
that?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, he&#146;s really great though. He has this incredible zest for
life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty
girl I am.</p>

<p>Monica: (To Ross) Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom
and dad this year?</p>

<p>Ross: Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20<sup>th</sup>?</p>

<p>Monica: Yeah, I&#146;d really like to.</p>

<p>Ross: Okay, hopefully this time mom won&#146;t boo you.</p>

<p>Monica: Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it&#146;s always really
moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I&#146;m going to make them cry.</p>

<p>Chandler: And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?</p>

<p>Monica: No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him,
and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, &quot;God, your
brother.&quot; Know what they&#146;ll say this year? &quot;God, you&quot;</p>

<p>Joey: Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. (Points to
himself) I&#146;m an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. (snaps fingers)</p>

<p>Monica: Really you can do that?</p>

<p>Joey: Are you kidding me? Watch! (Makes funny faces trying to cry) Well I
can&#146;t do it with you guys watching me!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Monica&#146;s, they&#146;re getting ready to leave for the party.]</p>

<p>Chandler: What are you doing?</p>

<p>Monica: Oh I&#146;m working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it.
Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out. (Hands him a picture.)</p>

<p>Chandler: It&#146;s a dog.</p>

<p>Monica: It&#146;s a dead dog. That&#146;s Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high
school.</p>

<p>Chandler: It&#146;s your parents&#146; anniversary and you&#146;re going to talk
about their dead pet?</p>

<p>Monica: The good stuff, huh?</p>

<p>(Ross, Joey, and Rachel enter)</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi!</p>

<p>Ross: Hey!</p>

<p>Joey: Hey!</p>

<p>Monica: You got a present for my parents. That&#146;s so sweet.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary, I had a
star named after them. </p>

<p>Ross: Aww that is so cool.</p>

<p>Joey: And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.</p>

<p>Rachel: Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia,
gingham, felt, (Pause) and I think my testacles may be in here too.</p>

<p>Ross: (picking up Chi-Chi&#146;s picture) Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog!
Y&#146;know Monica couldn&#146;t get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.</p>

<p>Monica: What?!</p>

<p>Ross: You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!</p>

<p>(Phoebe and Parker enter)</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey!</p>

<p><strong>All:</strong> Hi!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is&#133;</p>

<p>Parker: No, no, no wait! Don&#146;t tell me. Let me guess. (Points as he says
their names) Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, I&#146;m sorry Phoebe didn&#146;t mention
you. (Chandler makes a face) Chandler, I&#146;m kidding all ready you&#146;re my favorite!</p>

<p>Chandler: Ha!</p>

<p>Parker: Why don&#146;t all of you tell me a little about your self?</p>

<p>Ross: Ah, actually, I&#146;m sorry we-we probably should get going.</p>

<p>Parker: (laughs) Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I? (Puts
hand on her stomach)</p>

<p>Rachel: I, uh, think you already are.</p>

<p>Parker: Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this
world more miraculous than&#151;Oh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?</p>

<p>Monica: That&#146;s my old dog. He passed away years ago.</p>

<p>Parker: Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend,
bow-wow. So where&#146;s the party?</p>

<p>Monica: It&#146;s out on the island. It&#146;s in Massapequa. </p>

<p>Parker: Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is
it steep in Native American history? {Transcriber&#146;s Note: Interestingly Alec Baldwin
was born in Massapequa.}</p>

<p>Ross: Well, there is an <i>Arby&#146;s</i> in the shape of a tee-pee.</p>

<p>Monica: Okay, I got my note cards. (To Chandler) Do you got the presents? </p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah.</p>

<p>Monica: And I&#146;ve got the car keys.</p>

<p>Parker: We&#146;re driving!?</p>

<p>Monica: Yeah.</p>

<p>Parker: Aces!</p>

<p>(Everyone except Ross and Rachel leave.)</p>

<p>Ross: So uh, he seems like a nice guy.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.</p>

<p>Ross: Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, otherwise I&#146;m not going.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Anniversary Party, Ross and Rachel are arriving and see his parents.]</p>

<p><strong>Mr. and</strong> Mrs. Geller: Hi</p>

<p>Ross: Hi! (Kisses his mom.) Hey mom.</p>

<p>Rachel: This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have
any pearls of wisdom? </p>

<p>Mrs. Geller: Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. Geller: Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick? (Looking a
toothpick)</p>

<p>Ross: That&#146;s a good question, dad. That&#146;s a good question&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: Hmmm&#133;.</p>

<p>Woman: (To Ross and Rachel) Congratulations you two!</p>

<p>Rachel: Thank you&#133;we&#146;re so excited</p>

<p>Woman: And also, congratulations on your wedding.</p>

<p>Ross: Wha&#151;What?</p>

<p>Mrs. Geller: Can we talk to you for just a y&#146;know&#133; It&#146;s just a
little thing. Well we think it&#146;s absolutely marvelous that you&#146;re having this
baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we&#146;ve
told them all that you&#146;re married.</p>

<p><strong>Ross and</strong> Rachel: What?!</p>

<p>Mrs. Geller: Thanks for going along with this.</p>

<p>Ross: Dad so what we have to pretend that we&#146;re married?</p>

<p>Mr. Geller: Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.</p>

<p>Ross: Can you believe that?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, if you&#146;re going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass
at the nosal area.</p>

<p>Ross: No, us having to lie about being married.</p>

<p>Rachel: No, I know I don&#146;t either, but ya know what, it&#146;s their party,
and it&#146;s just one night. And we don&#146;t even have to lie; we just won&#146;t say
anything. If it comes up again, we&#146;ll just&#133;smile. We&#146;ll nod along.</p>

<p>Woman: Ross!</p>

<p>Man: Rachel!</p>

<p>Ross: Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan</p>

<p>Aunt Lisa: Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding</p>

<p><strong>Ross and</strong> Rachel: Hmmmm&#133;.</p>

<p>Uncle Dan: Here&#146;s a little something to get you started. (Hands them a
check)</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh&#133;</p>

<p>Aunt Lisa: So, how&#146;s married life treating you?</p>

<p>Rachel: (looking at the check) Unbelievable!</p>

<p>Ross: We love marriage!</p>

<p>Aunt Lisa: Great!</p>

<p>(The rest of the gang arrives including Parker.)</p>

<p>Ross: Hey</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey!</p>

<p>Parker: What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being
here with all of you in Event Room C&#133;I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times
that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none
of them will compare with tonight! My God, I don&#146;t want to forget this moment!
It&#146;s like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click! (He takes a mental
picture of them all.)</p>

<p>Chandler: I don&#146;t think the flash went off.</p>

<p>Parker: Dahaaa! (Punches Chandler in the arm and he makes a face of pain.)
I&#146;m going to find the men&#146;s room, be right back.</p>

<p>Phoebe: I&#146;ll go with you</p>

<p>Parker: Come on!</p>

<p>Chandler: Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge
butterfly net looking for that man.</p>

<p>Joey: I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don&#146;t want him complimenting
my thing.</p>

<p>Ross: I&#146;m so we weren&#146;t in the car! Did he ever let up?</p>

<p>Monica: He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.</p>

<p>Ross: (imitating Parker) This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must
take a mental picture! (He backs into someone.) Ooh sorry&#133;(He looks behind him then
notices its Phoebe then stops his impression.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: Were you guys making fun of Parker?</p>

<p>Ross: That depends, how much did you hear?</p>

<p>Phoebe: So, he a little enthusiastic, what&#146;s wrong with that?</p>

<p>Monica: It&#146;s just that, it&#146;s so much.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you&#146;ve dated?
Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don&#146;t do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do
you want it? &#145;Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the
who&#146;s who of human crap. (Walks off)</p>

<p>Monica: I feel terrible.</p>

<p>Joey: I know</p>

<p>Ross: What was wrong with Mona?</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The Anniversary Party, Ross and Rachel have just gotten another wedding
present.]</p>

<p>Rachel: Open it! Open it! Open it!</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah baby!</p>

<p>Man: So we never got to hear about your wedding!</p>

<p>Woman: We were surprise that we weren&#146;t invited.</p>

<p>Ross: No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small
wedding.</p>

<p>Rachel: But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.</p>

<p>Man: Where did you have it?</p>

<p>Rachel: On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang <i>Isn&#146;t
She Lovely</i> as I walked down the aisle.</p>

<p>Woman: Really? </p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, Stevie&#146;s an old family friend. (Hits Ross&#146;s chest)</p>

<p>Woman: Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.</p>

<p>Rachel: So would I. You wouldn&#146;t think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to
put film in the camera.</p>

<p>Ross: Would you excuse us for a second? (Pulls Rachel off to the side)
Umm&#133;. what are you doing?</p>

<p>Rachel: What? I&#146;m not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want
it to be amazing.</p>

<p>Ross: Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a <i>Harley</i>. </p>

<p>Rachel: Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.</p>

<p>(Cut to Phoebe and Parker)</p>

<p>Parker: Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.</p>

<p>Phoebe: No, I&#146;m fine. I&#146;m great. I&#146;m with you.</p>

<p>Parker: And I&#146;m with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this
plate-bouncy thing. (Bounces the plates) What an inspired solution to man&#146;s plate
dispensing problems. </p>

<p>Phoebe: Hm huh, yeah.</p>

<p>Parker: Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.</p>

<p>Phoebe: No, that&#146;s not necessary.</p>

<p>Parker: Please.</p>

<p>Phoebe: No, actually I don&#146;t eat&#133;</p>

<p>Parker: I won&#146;t quit until you try.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay, fine! Fine! (Takes the oyster and pretends to eat it while
dropping it on the floor) Mmm&#133;hmmmmm&#133;.</p>

<p>Parker: What are they like? I&#146;ve never had one.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Why don&#146;t you just try one?</p>

<p>Parker: No, they look too weird.</p>

<p>(Cut to Monica and Chandler)</p>

<p>Chandler: What are you doin&#146;?</p>

<p>Monica: Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit &#145;em. I
can&#146;t wait. They&#146;re going to be crying so hard. They&#146;re going to be
fighting for breath. </p>

<p>Chandler: Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could
(Punches the air).</p>

<p>(Cut to Rachel and Ross)</p>

<p>Rachel: And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.</p>

<p>Woman: Blind?</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even
though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.</p>

<p>Aunt Lisa: I&#146;ll bet you looked beautiful&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, I don&#146;t know about that, but some said that I looked like a
floating angel.</p>

<p>Woman: (To Ross) So, how did you propose?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh yeah. That&#146;s a great story.</p>

<p>Ross: Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium.
That&#146;s-that&#146;s where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room
filled with lilies, her favorite flower&#133;</p>

<p>Aunt Lisa: Oh that is so sweet!</p>

<p>Rachel: Shhh! I want to hear the rest!</p>

<p>Ross: Then, Fred Astaire singing <i>The Way You Look Tonight</i> came on the
sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the
dome in the stars were the words &quot;Will you marry me?&quot;</p>

<p>(Various oohs and ahhs)</p>

<p>Rachel: And the ring, was the size of my fist (makes a fist)!</p>

<p>(Cut to Phoebe and Joey)</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were
being jerks. Parker&#146;s a nice guy and I&#146;d like to get to know him.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Then you better do it now.</p>

<p>Joey: Why?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Because I&#146;m going to kill him</p>

<p>Joey: What-what? </p>

<p>Phoebe: You guys were right. He&#146;s just too excited about&#133;everything. I
mean I&#146;m all for living life, but this is the Geller&#146;s 35<sup>th</sup>
anniversary. Okay? Let&#146;s call a spade a spade this party stinks.</p>

<p>Joey: I know I&#146;m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the
buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Are you sure it wasn&#146;t an oyster?</p>

<p>Joey: I guess it could&#146;ve been, I didn&#146;t really look at it.
Y&#146;know, I just wiped it on Chandler&#146;s coat and got the hell out of there.</p>

<p>Phoebe: He&#146;s just such a great guy I&#146;m so excited about him.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There&#146;s nothing wrong with
him he&#146;s a good guy. </p>

<p>Phoebe: You think?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.</p>

<p>Phoebe: You&#146;re right. You&#146;re right, he&#146;s just embracing life. We
could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I&#146;m a
sunny, positive person. </p>

<p>Joey: Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.</p>

<p>Phoebe: What&#146;s that now?</p>

<p>Joey: Nothing&#133;</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh look it&#146;s Parker! </p>

<p>Parker: Look! It&#146;s the bunny hop!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oooh I love it!</p>

<p>Parker: You do?!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!</p>

<p>(Cut to Monica, at the microphone)</p>

<p>Monica: Okay it&#146;s time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually
gives the toast, but this year I&#146;m going to do it.</p>

<p>(Everyone sighs)</p>

<p>Monica: No, no it&#146;s going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got
married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two
of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I
probably don&#146;t say it enough, but I love you. (Pretends to cry hoping her parents
will join her.) When I look around this room, I&#146;m-I&#146;m saddened by the thought of
those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be
here, but she can&#146;t because she&#146;s dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how
cute she is. (Holds up the picture and pretends to cry again). Was. (To an old man by the
stage.) Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she&#146;s dead. Okay, her and
Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her
children in <i>Terms of Endearment</i>? (Chandler covers his ears) Didn&#146;t see that?
No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching <i>60 Minutes</i>
these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. (Waits
for people to cry, but doesn&#146;t get any tears.) You people are made of stone!
Here&#146;s to mom and dad! Whatever!</p>

<p>Mrs. Geller: Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn&#146;t it
interesting, Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. Geller: (looking at the picture) Why don&#146;t I remember this dog?</p>

<p>Mrs. Geller: Ross, why don&#146;t you give us your toast now?</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, no, Mom, it&#146;s just Monica this year.</p>

<p>Mrs. Geller: You&#146;re not going to say anything? On our 35<sup>th</sup>
wedding anniversary</p>

<p>Ross: No, of course, Um&#133; Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say&#133;on
behalf of my new bride, Rachel (She turns around and smiles), and myself. Umm, that
if&#133;if in 35 years, we&#146;re half as happy as you guys are, we&#146;ll count
ourselves the luckiest people in the world.</p>

<p>Mrs. Geller: (crying) Oh Ross&#133;</p>

<p>Mr. Geller: I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross&#146;s toast.</p>

<p>[Scene: Phoebe&#146;s apartment, Parker and her are entering.]</p>

<p>Parker: My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium? </p>

<p>Parker: I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words&#133;</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh thank God. </p>

<p>Parker: It&#146;s a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the
midst&#133;</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don&#146;t we just um, sit and
relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly! </p>

<p>Parker: That sounds great. (Sits down) My God this is the most comfortable couch
I&#146;ve ever sat on in my entire life. (Bounces on couch)</p>

<p>Phoebe: Let&#146;s try something else, let&#146;s play a game.</p>

<p>Parker: I love games!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Shocking! Let&#146;s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
(Giggles)</p>

<p>Parker: Or&#133;<i>Jenga</i>.</p>

<p>Phoebe: But, let&#146;s play this one first. And remember whoever talks first
loses! </p>

<p>(They sit back)</p>

<p>Parker: I lose, now <i>Jenga</i>.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh my God! Oh my God! </p>

<p>Parker: Is something wrong?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn&#146;t perfect?
Everything isn&#146;t magical? Everything isn&#146;t a glow with the light of a million
fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker! </p>

<p>Parker: Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!</p>

<p>Phoebe: You don&#146;t have to put a good spin on everything.</p>

<p>Parker: I&#146;m sorry that&#146;s who I am. I&#146;m a positive person.</p>

<p>Phoebe: No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at <i>Disneyland</i>,
getting laid! </p>

<p>Parker: So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less
happy?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Much less happy!</p>

<p>Parker: Fine! Well then to quote Ross, &quot;I&#146;d better be going.&quot; </p>

<p>Phoebe: So long! Don&#146;t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on
your way out! (He exits and she slams the door behind him.)</p>

<p>(There&#146;s a knock on door, and Phoebe opens it.)</p>

<p>Parker: Isn&#146;t this the most incredible fight you&#146;ve ever had in your
entire life? </p>

<p>Phoebe: Uh huh. (Closes door)</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel&#146;s, they&#146;re returning from the party.]</p>

<p>Ross: &#133;and then, we could&#146;ve gone from the ceremony to the reception
with you in the sidecar!</p>

<p>Rachel: Ross, it just wouldn&#146;t have been feasible.</p>

<p>Ross: But having a dove place the ring on your finger would&#146;ve been no
problem?</p>

<p>Rachel: It was really fun being married to you tonight. </p>

<p>Ross: Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I&#146;ve ever made.</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah.</p>

<p>Rachel: That proposal, at the planetarium&#133;</p>

<p>Ross: I know, I know it was stupid. </p>

<p>Rachel: Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the
stars! It was&#133;really wonderful! Did you just make that up? </p>

<p>Ross: No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It&#146;s
how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me. </p>

<p>Rachel: Well, that would&#146;ve been very hard to say no too. </p>

<p>Ross: It&#146;s a good thing I didn&#146;t do it, because it sounds like it
would&#146;ve been a very expensive wedding. (Rachel laughs) Okay, good night</p>

<p>Rachel: Goodnight</p>

<p>(They go off to their bedrooms)</p>

<p>Ross: Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn&#146;t get messed
up? </p>

<p>Rachel: I will think about it. </p>

<p>Ross: That&#146;s all I&#146;m askin&#146; </p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Monica are there.]</p>

<p>Monica: Okay that&#146;s it. I give up. At mom and dad&#146;s 40<sup>th</sup>
anniversary, you&#146;re the one giving the speech. </p>

<p>Ross: Y&#146;know I don&#146;t understand why they didn&#146;t cry. It was a
beautiful speech. </p>

<p>Monica: Oh, come on. </p>

<p>Ross: Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we
did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.
And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would&#146;ve wanted to be there. And
you know what? I think she was. </p>

<p>Monica: (starts to cry) Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it? </p>
