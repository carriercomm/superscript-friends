<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is looking around the shop as Phoebe returns from getting
some more coffee.]</p>

<p>Rachel: Phoebe?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah?</p>

<p>Rachel: Look at that guy by the window, wow!</p>

<p>Phoebe: He&#146;s awfully short and I think he&#146;s talking to himself. And to
be completely honest, he&#146;s not that good in bed.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it&#146;s like every guy I
see&#151;I mean look here. (Points behind them) Look at that guy for example, I mean
normally that&#146;s not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the
way I&#146;m feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah.</p>

<p>Phoebe: This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start
going crazy.</p>

<p>Rachel: Really?! So this has happened to you?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so
in, y&#146;know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.</p>

<p>Rachel: Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store
sitting on Santa&#146;s lap.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander
Holyfield from a <i>Foot Locker</i>.</p>

<p>Rachel: Ah.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, y&#146;know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I&#146;ll ask her
about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah. Yeah, that&#146;s what you need a good&#133;pill.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Ross are there as Mona enters.]</p>

<p>Mona: Hey! (To Joey) Hey!</p>

<p>Ross: Hi!</p>

<p>Mona: Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona
ice skating?</p>

<p>Joey: Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
(Brushes something off of his shirt and looks around, but doesn&#146;t move from his
chair.)</p>

<p>Ross: Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us
together?</p>

<p>Mona: Oh yeah, probably at the end. (Flips to the end.) Oh my God! He only took
pictures of my breasts!</p>

<p>Joey: I&#146;m missin&#146; picture time?! (Jumps over to look, Ross glares at
him and he retreats.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: (sitting down next to Ross) Y&#146;know she has a face Ross!</p>

<p>Mona: Okay. Okay, here&#146;s a good one of us.</p>

<p>Ross: Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card
y&#146;know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.</p>

<p>Mona: Y&#146;know, every year I say I&#146;m gonna send out holiday cards and I
never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?</p>

<p>Ross: (pause) Together? Like-like to people?</p>

<p>Mona: Yeah, y&#146;know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It&#146;ll be cute,
okay?</p>

<p>Ross: Okay. (Not happy about it.)</p>

<p>Mona: Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?</p>

<p>Ross: Uh sure, sure.</p>

<p>Mona: Bye guys.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Bye.</p>

<p>(Mona exits.)</p>

<p>Joey: (To Ross) Congratulations! You just got married!</p>

<p>Ross: I know. Can you believe that?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Wait, I&#146;m-I&#146;m sorry. What&#146;s the big deal about a holiday
card?</p>

<p>Ross: Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have
been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!</p>

<p>Joey: Hey-hey-hey, hey that&#146;s your wife you&#146;re talking about!</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler&#146;s Office, his boss Doug is entering, Monica is there as well.]</p>

<p>Doug: Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!</p>

<p>Chandler: Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?</p>

<p>Monica: Yes, hi.</p>

<p>Doug: Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.</p>

<p>Chandler: I didn&#146;t know you and Carol were getting divorced, I&#146;m
sorry.</p>

<p>Doug: Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations
to you guys though!</p>

<p>Monica: No leg-chewing for us sir.</p>

<p>Doug: Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we&#146;ve got a lot
to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?</p>

<p>Monica: I can&#146;t think of anything we&#146;re doing. (Quietly) Why
can&#146;t I think of anything we&#146;re doing?</p>

<p>Doug: Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep
throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!</p>

<p>Monica: Okay, I&#146;ll see you tomorrow! (Doug exits.) Just so you know,
we&#146;re not seeing him tomorrow. (Chandler wonders why.) I-I cannot spend another
evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?</p>

<p>Chandler: No.</p>

<p>Monica: That&#146;s because he wasn&#146;t invited because of the way he behaved
at our engagement party.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture
doesn&#146;t it?</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's Apartment, there&#146;s a knock on the door and he opens it to Mona.]</p>

<p>Mona: Hi!</p>

<p>Ross: Hey!</p>

<p>Mona: Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card.
What do you think?</p>

<p>Ross: Huh. Wow, this is great.</p>

<p>Mona: Now, do you think it should say, &quot;Love Ross and Mona?&quot;</p>

<p>Ross: Well, we-we haven&#146;t said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay
to say it to other people.</p>

<p>Mona: How many did you want? I&#146;m getting a hundred.</p>

<p>Ross: A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I&#146;ll take a&#151;Mona, uh&#133;I-I&#146;m
not sure about the whole uh, card thing.</p>

<p>Mona: Really? Why not?</p>

<p>Ross: Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don&#146;t know if
we&#146;re really quite there yet.</p>

<p>Mona: Oh y&#146;know, I didn&#146;t think of it that way. You&#146;re right.
You&#146;re right. So, can I ask you a question? </p>

<p>Ross: Yeah.</p>

<p>Mona: Where are we?</p>

<p>Ross: Huh.</p>

<p>Mona: Y&#146;know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?</p>

<p>Ross: Hmm&#133;</p>

<p>Mona: I mean I love spending time with you, y&#146;know I just&#151;I hope
we&#146;re moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don&#146;t you
think?</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>Ross: Let&#146;s do the card!</p>

<p>Mona: What?</p>

<p>Ross: The card! I think we&#146;re there!</p>

<p>Mona: Okay. I&#151;But I think we should still have this conversation.</p>

<p>Ross: Really?! I mean, even with the card?</p>

<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s Doctor&#146;s Office, she is waiting for her doctor as a nurse
enters.]</p>

<p>Nurse: Hi!</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi!</p>

<p>Nurse: Just so you know, Dr. Long can&#146;t be here today, she was called to
the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy
who took my blood sample really cute? Y&#146;know who I&#146;m talking about, bald
haircut, hairy fingers&#133; (Stops when she realizes it was her.)</p>

<p>Dr. Schiff: (entering) Hi Rachel? I&#146;m Dr. Schiff. (By the way, he&#146;s an
attractive man.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Yes, you are.</p>

<p>Dr. Schiff: So, how&#146;s it going?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are
you from? What do you do?</p>

<p>Dr. Schiff: I&#146;m a doctor.</p>

<p>Rachel: Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you
ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?</p>

<p>Dr. Schiff: Uh, I don&#146;t have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!</p>

<p>Dr. Schiff: So, are you experiencing any discomfort?</p>

<p>Rachel: No. I&#146;m very comfortable.</p>

<p>Dr. Schiff: Any painful gas?</p>

<p>Rachel: No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!</p>

<p>Dr. Schiff: Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?</p>

<p>Rachel: Well would you like me to lie down on the table?</p>

<p>Dr. Schiff: I&#146;m sorry, is there something going on here?</p>

<p>Rachel: Do you feel it too?</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Monica and Phoebe are there as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh hey! So, how did your doctor&#146;s appointment go?</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, let&#146;s see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the
middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh my God.</p>

<p>Monica: Why did you do that?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my
fourth month of
pregnancy?</p>

<p>Monica: Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you
practically came on to me.</p>

<p>Phoebe: You wish.</p>

<p>Monica: Hey, I could&#146;ve had you if I wanted you.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh yeah? Come and get it.</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay, even this is turning me on!</p>

<p>Ross: (entering) Hey!</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how&#146;s it, how&#146;s it going with you and
Mona? Are you guys still together?</p>

<p>Ross: Oh yeah, yeah we&#146;re moving forward. You&#146;ll be getting our card!</p>

<p>Monica: You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, we&#146;re not just doing a card! Y&#146;know, she-she also wants to
have the conversation about where the relationship is going.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Ugh! Women!</p>

<p>Ross: I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I
mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, &quot;So, where is this going?&quot;</p>

<p>Rachel: Uh Ross? You asked me that.</p>

<p>Ross: Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I&#146;m not a mind reader! Besides, I
hate those conversations. I&#146;m horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a
gesture. Y&#146;know, something that says we&#146;re moving forward without having to talk
about it.</p>

<p>Monica: Like asking her to move in with you?</p>

<p>Ross: Smaller than that.</p>

<p>Monica: Making her a mixed tape?</p>

<p>Ross: Uh, bigger than that.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Give her a key to your apartment.</p>

<p>Ross: Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.</p>

<p>Monica: All right. Have you said, &quot;I love you?&quot; You could say, I love
you.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah I-I don&#146;t-I don&#146;t think I&#146;m quite there yet, but I
could say I looove spending time with you.</p>

<p>Phoebe: No, we hate that.</p>

<p>Monica: That is a slap in the face.</p>

<p>Ross: Forget it. I-I&#151;Y&#146;know what? I&#146;ll just have the
conversation. I&#146;ll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best.
What do you think Rach?</p>

<p>Rachel: I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples
through that sweater.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler&#146;s Office, Doug is entering.]</p>

<p>Doug: Bing! We&#146;re all set for tonight, 8 o&#146;clock.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh uh, as it turns out, we can&#146;t do it. Monica has to work.</p>

<p>Doug: Oh, my ex-wife didn&#146;t work, unless you call turning into her mother
work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh uh well tomorrow&#146;s no good for her either.</p>

<p>Doug: Oh? Why not?</p>

<p>Chandler: It&#146;s the semi-finals&#133;of her&#133;botchy ball tournament.</p>

<p>Doug: What&#146;s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or
something?</p>

<p>Chandler: Well now-now you&#146;re just talking crazy.</p>

<p>Doug: So why can&#146;t the three of us go out together?</p>

<p>Chandler: Because uh&#133;we-we&#133;we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold
me.</p>

<p>Doug: Good God Bing I&#133;well I can&#146;t say I&#146;m altogether surprised,
I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at
me, pure lust.</p>

<p>Chandler: Y&#146;know what would really help me through this tough time is
choking something. Can I choke ya?</p>

<p>Doug: Bing my boy, we&#146;re gonna get you over this. Now here&#146;s the plan,
grab your coat, we&#146;re going to a strip club.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. (Doug looks at him.) But to hell with
that bitch.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is getting Mona some coffee.]</p>

<p>Ross: Here we go. Mona umm, I think it&#146;s time we-we had a conversation
about-about where things are with us.</p>

<p>Mona: Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.</p>

<p>Ross: Aw, we-we are so&#133;(Motions that they&#146;re connected.) So umm, well
I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y&#146;know hanging out with you. And I mean-I&#146;m
having a lot of fun. (He pauses and thinks there might be more, but decides there
isn&#146;t.)</p>

<p>Mona: Okay.</p>

<p>Ross: I mean, there&#146;s no point in spending time with someone if-if
it&#146;s just fun. It&#146;s gotta be, it&#146;s gotta be going somewhere right? So
where-where is it going? (Pause) Ah! That&#146;s-that&#146;s the real question. And-and
the answer is&#133;is it&#146;s going somewhere&#133;fun. Now I-I know what you&#146;re
thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y&#146;know, but you&#146;re-you&#146;re
not getting any younger. No I mean&#151;No not you, not you, you&#151;you are
getting younger. I mean&#151;you-you look like you&#146;re getting younger by the
second&#151;What&#146;s your secret?</p>

<p>Mona: I&#146;m sorry, so umm, so where are we?</p>

<p>Ross: Well, well to sum up, we&#146;re having fun, you look young.</p>

<p>Mona: Okay&#133;</p>

<p>Ross: But that&#146;s not enough. So&#133; So&#133;here&#146;s a key to my
apartment. (Hands her his key.)</p>

<p>Mona: Really?!</p>

<p>Ross: Really.</p>

<p>Mona: You don&#146;t think this is too fast. </p>

<p>(Ross groans no.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Ross is telling Rachel and Monica about yet another mistake
he&#146;s made with a woman.]</p>

<p>Rachel: You gave her a key to your apartment?!</p>

<p>Ross: Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a
very serious relationship.</p>

<p>Phoebe: (entering with some guy) Hey. Ooh Ross! How&#146;d the conversation go?</p>

<p>Ross: Oh great, I live on the street.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Where?! (Ross exits.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Hey!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.</p>

<p><strong>Roger:</strong> Hey everybody.</p>

<p>Monica: Hi Roger.</p>

<p>Phoebe: So umm, I&#146;m gonna get us some drinks. (To Rachel) Would you help me
out?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah. (They go into the kitchen.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: Umm, he&#146;s here to have sex with you.</p>

<p>Rachel: What?</p>

<p>Phoebe: You&#146;re welcome.</p>

<p>Rachel: Phoebe no!</p>

<p>Phoebe: It&#146;s okay, he&#146;s a virgin.</p>

<p>Monica: Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he&#146;ll have
sex with you.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, okay let&#146;s leave these two alone.</p>

<p>Rachel: No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do
it with some random guy!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
(Phoebe exits.)</p>

<p>[Scene: A Strip Club, Doug and Chandler are there.]</p>

<p>Doug: Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap
dance with those girls. Huh?</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh that&#146;s all right sir, and that&#146;s just one girl.</p>

<p>Doug: Bing&#151;What&#146;s this?! (Grabs his hand.)</p>

<p>Chandler: It&#146;s a hand. It&#146;s a thing you use as a <i>Jack</i> and <i>Coke</i>
holder.</p>

<p>Doug: No, it&#146;s a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We&#146;re gonna go
to the East River right now and throw it in there!</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh no-no-no!</p>

<p>Doug: Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y&#146;know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better
and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross's Apartment, a locksmith has finished changing the locks on Ross&#146;s
door.]</p>

<p>Ross: Okay, and oh I&#146;m gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give
them away for no reason at all.</p>

<p>Mona: (entering) Hey Ross, what&#146;s going on? You changing the lock?</p>

<p>Ross: No. That guy is.</p>

<p>Mona: I don&#146;t understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then
you change the lock.</p>

<p><strong>Locksmith:</strong> Good luck buddy. (Exits.)</p>

<p>Mona: Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you&#146;re-you&#146;re
sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?</p>

<p>Ross: I&#146;m trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.</p>

<p>Mona: What?</p>

<p>Ross: I love you!</p>

<p>Mona: Ohh! (Hugs him.) And I love spending time with you. (Ross isn&#146;t
happy.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is eating dinner as Chandler enters.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Hi honey I&#146;m home.</p>

<p>Monica: From the tequila factory?</p>

<p>Chandler: It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that
you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then
when I wouldn&#146;t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!</p>

<p>Monica: Come here. I can breath through my mouth.</p>

<p>Chandler: Y&#146;know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would
be like without you. It was like <i>It&#146;s a Wonderful Life</i> with lap dances. Please
promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each
other for the rest of our lives.</p>

<p>Monica: I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday
card this year?</p>

<p>Chandler: Ooh, I don&#146;t know if we&#146;re there yet.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is on the phone.]</p>

<p>Rachel: Yes. Hi, I&#146;d like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question?
Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very <i>Ambercrombie &amp; Fitch</i>. (Joey
enters.) I&#146;ll call you back.</p>

<p>Joey: Who was that?</p>

<p>Rachel: It&#146;s just the pizza place.</p>

<p>Joey: You hung up on the pizza place? I don&#146;t hang up on your friends.</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m sorry honey, I&#146;m just having a, having a rough day.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, what&#146;s wrong?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh you really, you really just don&#146;t want to hear about it.</p>

<p>Joey: Then why did I ask?</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay, it&#146;s just&#151;and this is really embarrassing&#151;but
lately with this whole pregnancy thing I&#146;m just finding myself&#133;how do I put this
umm, erotically charged.</p>

<p>Joey: Is that college talk for horny?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah. So y&#146;know, I have all of these feelings and I don&#146;t know
what to do about them, because I can&#146;t date like a normal person, which is fine
because I don&#146;t need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night.
Just sex, y&#146;know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel
comfortable with and who knows what he&#146;s doing. For just one great night, I mean is
that really so&#133;hard&#133;to find. (Looks at Joey.) So how was your day?</p>

<p>Joey: Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, I gotta get up early and it&#146;s almost seven o&#146;clock.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay, good night!</p>

<p>Joey: Good night. (They both enter their rooms.)</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>Joey: (entering) I can&#146;t do it!</p>

<p>Rachel: (entering) I didn&#146;t ask you to do it!</p>

<p>Joey: You&#146;re Rachel!</p>

<p>Rachel: You&#146;re Joey!</p>

<p>Joey: You&#146;re my friend!</p>

<p>Rachel: Right back at ya!</p>

<p>Joey: But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.</p>

<p>Rachel: And so bad. I don&#146;t even know what you&#146;re talking about
because I didn&#146;t ask you to do anything!</p>

<p>Joey: I know!</p>

<p>(Pause.)</p>

<p>Joey: Do you wanna do it?</p>

<p>Rachel: No!</p>

<p>Joey: All right, me neither! I was just testing you!</p>

<p>Rachel: That&#146;s the end of this conversation!</p>

<p>Joey: This conversation never happened!</p>

<p>Rachel: Never happened! Good night!</p>

<p>Joey: Good night!</p>

<p>(They both go into their rooms and after a little while Rachel pokes her head into the
living room.)</p>

<p>Joey: Get back in there! (Rachel re-enters her room and closes the door.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel is there as Phoebe enters.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hi. Listen, I&#146;m sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really
wasn&#146;t right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something
that I think you&#146;ll really enjoy. (Goes into the hallway and returns carrying the
Evander Holyfield cutout.) Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I&#146;m gonna, I&#146;m gonna
want him back. So&#133; (Looks at him longingly) I&#146;m gonna go now. (Exits.) (Pause)
(Entering) I&#146;m sorry, I thought I could do it and I can&#146;t! (She grabs the cutout
and exits for good.)</p>
