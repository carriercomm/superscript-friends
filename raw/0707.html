<p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is eating breakfast as Rachel enters having just woken
up.]</p>

<p>Joey: Morning!</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?</p>

<p>Joey: Pretty good.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a
naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts
Joey.)</p>

<p>Joey: Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I&#146;m late for work.</p>

<p>Rachel: What-what?! You&#146;re gonna leave this person with me?!</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah&#151;Hey, don&#146;t worry, she&#146;s a terrific girl. And hey
listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I&#146;m
not looking for a serious relationship; that&#146;d be great.</p>

<p>Rachel: Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!</p>

<p>Joey: Just casually slip it in, y&#146;know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh,
I&#146;m a loner&#151;No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn&#146;t want to get mixed up with
the likes of me.</p>

<p>Rachel: Y&#146;know what? That&#146;s a lot to remember, can&#146;t I just tell
her you&#146;re a pig?</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, I&#146;m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to
do it! He&#146;d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he&#146;d make extras and leave
&#145;em for me.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well forget it, I&#146;m not telling that girl anything. That is not my
responsibility.</p>

<p>Joey: Fine! (Pause) Now, where&#146;d we land on those pancakes? (She chases him
out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)</p>


<p>Joey&#146;s Date: Hi!</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi.</p>


<p>Joey&#146;s Date: Sorry about that, but I couldn&#146;t get that lock to work on
the door.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.</p>


<p>Joey&#146;s Date: You must be Rachel, I&#146;m Erin.</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi.</p>

<p>Erin: Hi. I don&#146;t mean this to sound like high school, but did he say
anything about me?</p>

<p>Rachel: (pause) Would you like some pancakes?</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: N.Y.U&#146;s University Library, Ross is entering with Chandler.]</p>

<p>Chandler: &#133;Come on! Why are we here?!</p>

<p>Ross: Okay, okay take a guess.</p>

<p>(An old woman pushes a cart full of books past.)</p>

<p>Chandler: The hot chicks?</p>

<p>Ross: Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier,
y&#146;know-y&#146;know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral
dissertation! It&#146;s here! Yeah, it&#146;s right-it&#146;s right down here! In the
biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded
section behind the racks.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Wow that&#146;s actually pretty cool.</p>

<p>Ross: (stopping quickly) Oh umm, there&#146;s also a book here by a woman named
Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next
aisle.) What is that?</p>

<p>Chandler: Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.</p>

<p>(They go around the last row of bookshelves and find a couple doing what college coeds
do in secluded corners of university libraries. For those of you who don&#146;t know what
I&#146;m talking about, let&#146;s just say that clothing is undone. Ross gasps and the
couple gets up and runs away.)</p>

<p>Female Student: (as they are moving past Ross) I&#146;m so sorry!</p>

<p>Male Student: Sorry!</p>

<p>Chandler: You didn&#146;t bring me here to do that, did you?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica&#146;s Restaurant Kitchen, Monica is cooking as a waitress enters
carrying a plate of food that has been sent back.]</p>

<p>Monica: She sent the chicken back again?!</p>

<p>The Waitress: She says it&#146;s to dry now and she wants to come back here and
explain to you exactly how she wants it.</p>

<p>Monica: Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!</p>

<p>(The waitress lets her in as Monica is about to throw a lobster into a pot of boiling
water (Although, she hasn&#146;t taken off the rubber bands that hold the claws, so she
can&#146;t be that good of a chef). Anyway, guess who the Colonel is by the
following phrase.)</p>


<p>The Colonel: OH&#133;MY&#133;GAWD!!!! (Yep, it&#146;s Janice.)</p>

<p>Monica: (to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around
to face the planet&#146;s most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of
course. She&#146;s the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice.</p>

<p>Janice: How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the
best chicken ever! (Does the laugh.)</p>

<p>Monica: I&#146;m fine.</p>

<p>Janice: (notices Monica&#146;s engagement ring) Ohh! What is that on your
finger?! I&#146;m blind!</p>

<p>Monica: Oh&#133; Uh&#133;</p>

<p>Janice: So, who&#146;s the lucky guy?</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica and Chandler&#146;s just after Monica has finished telling Chandler what
happened.]</p>

<p>Chandler: OH&#133;MY&#133;GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You
didn&#146;t tell her we were getting married, did you?</p>

<p>Monica: Well, she saw the ring.</p>

<p>Chandler: Did she freak out?</p>

<p>Monica: Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most
people.</p>

<p>Chandler: Right.</p>

<p>Monica: Well, she actually has a boyfriend y&#146;know herself, named Clark. Uh,
she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.</p>

<p>Chandler: (laughs) You said no right?</p>

<p>Monica: Huh?</p>

<p>Chandler: You said no right?!</p>

<p>Monica: Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what
was I supposed to do?!</p>

<p>Chandler: Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check&#146;s in the mail! Oh your baby
is so cute! I can&#146;t wait to read your book Ross!!</p>

<p>Monica: Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won&#146;t be so bad.</p>

<p>Chandler: What do you think she&#146;s just gonna sit there quietly? You
don&#146;t think she&#146;s gonna want to make a toast? You don&#146;t think she&#146;s
gonna want to grab the microphone and sing <i>Part-time Lover</i>?!</p>

<p>Monica: Oh my God, she&#146;s not gonna like the chicken that night either is
she?!</p>

<p>Chandler: Y&#146;know what? It&#146;s gonna be okay. Y&#146;know what?
She&#146;s probably not gonna even want to come.</p>

<p>Monica: Really?</p>

<p>Chandler: No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?</p>

<p>Monica: So-so you would&#146;ve just lied?</p>

<p>Chandler: Yes!!</p>

<p>Monica: Would it really have been that easy?</p>

<p>Chandler: Yes!!!</p>

<p>Monica: Good, so do it Saturday night because we&#146;re going to dinner with
her and Clark.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is coming back from work to find Phoebe, Rachel, and
someone else with her back turned is there.]</p>

<p>Joey: Hey! What&#146;s up?</p>


<p>Phoebe and Rachel: Hey!</p>

<p>Joey: Hey-hey, who&#146;s your friend? (Erin turns around to face Joey,
startling him) Hey!!</p>

<p>Erin: Hey Joey!</p>

<p>Joey: Erin! Still here!</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!</p>

<p>Joey: Why wouldn&#146;t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there&#146;s you guys.</p>

<p>Erin: Ohh, listen. I&#146;ve got to get going. Today was great, thanks!</p>

<p>Rachel: I know!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay!</p>

<p>Erin: Bye Joey. (Kisses him.) Last night was fun.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah. I&#146;ll uh, I&#146;ll call ya.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh and I&#146;ll call ya too!</p>

<p>Erin: Or I&#146;ll call you!</p>

<p>Phoebe: And call me!</p>

<p>Joey: (to Erin) Okay, good to see you again.</p>

<p>Erin: Bye.</p>

<p>Joey: Bye-bye.</p>

<p>Rachel: Bye!</p>

<p>(Joey closes the door behind her.) </p>

<p>Joey: So, system kinda broke down huh?!</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh Joey, I&#146;m sorry I just couldn&#146;t tell her all those things
you wanted me to tell her. And y&#146;know we got to talking and I&#133;</p>

<p>Phoebe: We want you to marry her!</p>

<p>Joey: What?!!</p>

<p>Phoebe: She is so amazing! You have no idea.</p>

<p>Joey: No idea? Who do you think brought her here?</p>

<p>Rachel: Cupid.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Joey, she&#146;s so cool. She speaks four languages.</p>

<p>Joey: Man, do you know what guys want!</p>

<p>Rachel: Look Joey, come on she&#146;s so perfect for you! I mean she&#146;s
sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.</p>

<p>Joey: My beers?! Look you guys, she&#146;s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good
time, but I just&#151;I don&#146;t see it going anywhere.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, but you always say that.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.</p>

<p>Joey: Look I&#146;m sorry you guys, I-I just don&#146;t think so.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Whatever.</p>

<p>Rachel: Fine. (They start to walk away.)</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, don&#146;t start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? You&#146;re the one
who&#146;s in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, you&#146;re the one
having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!</p>

<p>Rachel: Phoebe!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Secret affair!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Joey are there as Ross enters.]</p>

<p>Ross: People are doing it in front of my book!</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m sorry?</p>

<p>Ross: My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it,
and there were students makin&#146; babies right in the middle of the Paleontology
section!</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?</p>

<p>Ross: Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on
campus where students went to uh, fool around.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, there was. It was&#151;there the corner of the library where-where
all these dusty books that nobody ever read&#151;Yes, there was.</p>

<p>Ross: Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it&#146;s like uh-a thing!</p>

<p>Joey: Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?</p>

<p>Ross: Oh for cryin&#146; out loud! (He storms out.)</p>

<p>Joey: All right, so we should go catch our movie.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well now what&#146;s the rush?</p>

<p>Joey: I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.</p>

<p>Phoebe: (entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!</p>

<p>Rachel: Well look who&#146;s here!</p>

<p>Erin: Hey!</p>

<p>Joey: Hey!</p>

<p>Erin: Joey.</p>

<p>Joey: Erin.</p>

<p>Erin: Hey Rachel.</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!</p>

<p>Erin: What&#146;s wrong?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh no.</p>

<p>Joey: (skeptical) What party?</p>


<p>Phoebe and Rachel: A birthday party.</p>

<p>Joey: Who&#146;s birthday party?</p>


<p>Phoebe and Rachel: Allison&#146;s birthday party.</p>

<p>Joey: (still skeptical) Oh, and how is Allison?</p>


<p>Phoebe and Rachel: 32. (Joey&#146;s not buying it.)</p>

<p>Rachel: (does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don&#146;t you guys do
something?!</p>

<p>Joey: (still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The Library, Ross enters and heads to the desk to talk to the male librarian on
duty.]</p>

<p>Ross: Excuse me. Hi, I&#146;m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology
section, fifth floor, stack 437?</p>

<p>The Librarian: Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.</p>

<p>Ross: No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian
brings his boss over.)</p>

<p>The Head Librarian: How can I help you?</p>

<p>Ross: Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the
Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people
are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.</p>

<p>The Head Librarian: We are aware of the problem you are referring too. (He turns
to look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, I&#146;m afraid the
library is very understaffed. I, I can&#146;t help you.</p>

<p>Ross: Well, fine. Fine! If-if I&#146;m the only person with any appreciation of
the sanctity of the written word, I&#146;ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to
do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And don&#146;t you follow me!</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are doing dishes as Joey enters.]</p>

<p>Joey: Hey.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey!</p>

<p>Rachel: How did it go with Erin?</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yay!! Oh so, you&#146;re not, you&#146;re not mad at us anymore?</p>

<p>Joey: No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the
first time we went out. Y&#146;know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Didn&#146;t you sleep together?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves
sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever
to have kids, well that&#146;s a&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: (gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin&#146; about having kids. Oh my
Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please don&#146;t get married before I do.</p>

<p>Joey: Okay.</p>

<p>[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are on their date with Janice and Clark,
however Clark is a no show and Janice is crying the Mississippi River about it.]</p>

<p>Janice: Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!</p>

<p>Monica: He might still show up.</p>

<p>Janice: Oh, what are you, stupid? It&#146;s been three hours.</p>

<p>Monica: Is that all?</p>

<p>Janice: I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don&#146;t you
tell about your lovely wedding?</p>

<p>Chandler: Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the
wedding. Um, it&#146;s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We&#146;re not even sure
why we&#146;re having it.</p>

<p>Monica: It&#146;s actually going to be just family.</p>

<p>Janice: Oh&#133;wait&#133;you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you
something now and be honest; do you want me to sing <i>Careless Whisper</i> or <i>Lady In
Red</i>?</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is entering and arguing baseball with Erin. Phoebe and
Rachel are already there.]</p>

<p>Joey: How can you say that?! The <i>Mets </i>have no closer!</p>

<p>Erin: What about Benitez?</p>

<p>Joey: What about Game 1 of the Series?</p>

<p>Erin: What about shut up?</p>

<p>Joey: You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin)
I&#146;ll be right back. </p>

<p>Erin: Okay. (Joey goes to get some coffee and Erin sits down.)</p>

<p>Rachel: So how&#146;s it goin&#146; with Joey?</p>

<p>Erin: Uh, okay.</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me
that you like him.</p>

<p>Erin: Look, he&#146;s a really great guy and I know that you really want
this to work out, but I just don&#146;t see this having a future.</p>

<p>Rachel: But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just
change your mind?!</p>

<p>Erin: Kinda.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Then change it back!</p>

<p>Erin: I&#146;m sorry I&#133; It&#146;s just there&#146;s no real spark.</p>

<p>Phoebe: No spark? Didn&#146;t you sleep together?</p>

<p>Erin: Yeah.</p>

<p>Rachel: Ugh, tramp!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Does Joey have any idea?</p>

<p>Erin: I really don&#146;t think he does. And y&#146;know what? Maybe you guys
could help clue him in. Y&#146;know, tell him I&#146;m-I&#146;m not interested in a
serious relationship or something.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, you mean like that you&#146;re kind of a loner.</p>

<p>Erin: Yeah! That would be great!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, and maybe that you&#146;re a real (She says something in Italian,
and it doesn&#146;t matter what she said. It&#146;s not important so I don&#146;t need
everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)</p>

<p>Erin: I&#146;m sorry?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh well, I guess Italian isn&#146;t one of the four languages you speak.</p>

<p>Joey: (returning) Hey! You wanna go?</p>

<p>Erin: Yeah, let&#146;s go.</p>

<p>Joey: Okay. See you guys later.</p>

<p>Erin: Bye guys.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, see ya.</p>

<p>Joey: (whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.</p>

<p>Phoebe: No, just a regular old flying dwarf.</p>

<p>[Scene: The library&#146;s Paleontology section, Ross is patrolling as a couple walks
up.]</p>

<p>Ross: Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?</p>

<p>Guy: Yeah, we were&#133;we were just looking around.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh-oh, you&#146;re-you&#146;re fellow scholars. What exactly were you
looking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester
Stock&#146;s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?</p>

<p>Guy: Uhh&#133;.</p>

<p>Ross: Ah&#133; Ah&#133;Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts
looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the
section.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion&#146;s views
on evolution?</p>

<p>Woman: Uh, actually I find Marion&#146;s views far to progressionist.</p>

<p>Ross: I find Marion&#146;s views far to progressionist.</p>

<p>Woman: I&#146;m sorry, who are you?</p>

<p>Ross: I&#146;m a professor here uh, Ross&#133;Geller.</p>

<p>Woman: Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It&#146;s uh&#151;Wait! (Grabs his
book off of the shelf.) Did you write this?</p>

<p>Ross: Yes! You&#146;re the person who checked out my book?!</p>

<p>Woman: Y&#146;know, you look nothing like I would&#146;ve thought.
You&#146;re&#133;you&#146;re so young.</p>

<p>Ross: Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.</p>

<p>[Time Lapse, Ross and the woman are now in a state of partial undress and are standing
in front of the head librarian with two security guards watching them.]</p>

<p>Ross: I am very&#133;very sorry.</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe and Rachel are watching TV as Joey enters.]</p>

<p>Joey: Hey!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey!</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi!</p>

<p>Phoebe: So how was, how was your date?</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this
ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still&#133; And guess what, I&#146;m
thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?</p>

<p>Joey: No-no-no-no-no! It&#146;s a surprise, but it&#146;s gonna be tricky
thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.</p>


<p>Phoebe and Rachel: Oh no, yeah.</p>

<p>Rachel: Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the
feeling from her today that uh, she&#146;s not lookin&#146; for a serious relationship.</p>

<p>Joey: Where are you gettin&#146; this?</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, she told me. She said she&#146;s kinda a loner.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh. Oh.</p>

<p>Rachel: Joey&#133;</p>

<p>Joey: No hey Rach, it&#146;s cool okay? Y&#146;know I&#146;m a loner too! (Heads
for his room.) Right?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey Joey, y&#146;know what? You are way to good for her.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and
tell &#145;em you&#146;re not looking for a relationship.</p>

<p>Joey: No! No. Don&#146;t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah?</p>

<p>Rachel: Do you want some pancakes?</p>

<p>Joey: (coming back out) Finally!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica are sitting at the kitchen
table and are still trying to decide what to do about Janice.]</p>

<p>Monica: What are we gonna do?</p>

<p>Chandler: I say we go with <i>Careless Whisper</i>.</p>

<p>(There&#146;s a knock on the door and Janice enters.)</p>

<p>Janice: Chandler?</p>

<p>Chandler: (To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?</p>

<p>Monica: Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?</p>

<p>Janice: Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I
just felt I couldn&#146;t really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open door
behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I was
wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with
family.</p>

<p>Monica: (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren&#146;t they?</p>

<p>Janice: Please, it&#146;s because otherwise I really don&#146;t know what I
might do.</p>

<p>Chandler: Aren&#146;t you just a tinsy bit curious?</p>

<p>Janice: (starting to cry) Do you have any tissues?</p>

<p>Monica: Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Janice: Okay! (She runs for the bathroom)</p>

<p>Monica: We&#146;ll just&#133;we&#146;ll just let her stay.</p>

<p>Chandler: No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!</p>

<p>Monica: Kinda like your Barca lounger.</p>

<p>Chandler: Is that what you&#146;re thinking about right now?</p>

<p>Monica: I never stop thinking about it.</p>

<p>Janice: Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I
take my bath.</p>

<p>Chandler: Janice, I&#146;m sorry but umm, you can&#146;t stay here tonight.</p>

<p>Janice: Why not?</p>

<p>Chandler: Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now
Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.</p>

<p>(And she does the laugh.)</p>

<p>Janice: Okay, I&#146;m going to need a comforter, but did you have a
hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do you
have a cat? &#145;Cause it&#146;s already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear
that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)</p>

<p>(Chandler does the same nasal sound to Chandler.)</p>

<p>Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!</p>

<p>Janice: Why?</p>

<p>Monica: Because Chandler still has feelings for you!</p>

<p>Janice: He does?</p>

<p>Chandler: Say again?</p>

<p>Monica: That&#146;s right. That&#146;s right. And that is why you can&#146;t
stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn&#146;t come to the wedding.</p>

<p>Chandler: Feelings, such strong feelings.</p>

<p>Monica: I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you
can.</p>

<p>Janice: Oh&#133;my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I&#146;ll go. (Starts
for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The library&#146;s Paleontology section, Ross is on patrol and stops a security
guard through the stack of books.]</p>

<p>Ross: (to the guard) Don&#146;t sweat it, I&#146;ve got this section covered.
Yeah, in fact I&#146;ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in
people&#146;s eye&#151;(The guard walks away)&#151;Okay, see you later. </p>

<p>(Ross resumes his patrol when his best friend and sister walk up and start to take off
their coats, but they stop when they see him.)</p>

<p>Chandler: I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)</p>
