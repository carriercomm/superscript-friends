<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Joey are sitting on the couch reading.]</p>

<p>Joey: Can I see the comics?</p>

<p>Chandler: This is the <i>New York Times</i>.</p>

<p>Joey: Okay, may I see the comics?</p>

<p>[Monica and Phoebe enter.]</p>

<p>Monica: Guys. I thought you were taking Ross to the game?</p>

<p>Chandler: We are. He&#146;s meeting us here.</p>

<p>Monica: No! Rachel is meeting us here.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh come on, they can be in the same room.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, you shoulda been there last night.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Why? What happened now?</p>

<p>Joey: Well Ross was hangin&#146; out over at our place, Rachel comes over to
borrow some moisturiser from Chandler....</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to
borrow something.</p>

<p>Joey: Anyway! Her and Ross just started yelling at each other.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Wait. Why was he yelling at her? He&#146;s the one who slept with
someone else. </p>

<p>Joey: Well, I guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened,
that she should of forgiven him by now.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what
he means. Oh my God, this is like <i>60 Minutes</i>, okay, when, when, at first
you&#146;re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know
you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.</p>

<p>Chandler: Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced.
Man, I hope Ross doesn&#146;t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Y'know I had a dream where Ross and Rachel were still together, they
never broke up. And we were all just like hanging out, and everyone was happy....</p>

<p>Joey: I had the same dream!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, and nobody slept with that Xerox girl. </p>

<p>Joey: Oh, I had the opposite dream.</p>

<p>Chandler: Y'know what maybe it&#146;s gonna be okay, I mean it&#146;s been a
week.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, I mean it&#146;s never taken me a week to get over a relationship.</p>

<p>Monica: It&#146;s never taken you more than a shower to get over a
relationship.</p>

<p>[Rachel enters.]</p>

<p>Monica: (seeing her) Okay, let&#146;s go!! Let&#146;s hit the road!!</p>

<p>Rachel: Hey!</p>

<p>Monica: Let&#146;s get the show on it! </p>

<p>Rachel: Okay, let me just get a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>Monica: Oh Rachel, I know the best coffee house and it&#146;s sooo close.</p>

<p>Rachel: Closer than here?</p>

<p>Phoebe: (turning around and picking a cup off of a table) Oh, hey, look, I found
coffee! (handing her the cup) Okay, let&#146;s skedaddle.</p>

<p>Rachel: Wait, I&#146;m not just gonna drink somebody&#146;s old coffee.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay, your highness.</p>

<p>[Ross enters behind Rachel, and look at each other for a moment.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: (in a deep voice, imitating Ross) Um, Rachel I&#146;m really sorry.
(imitating Rachel) That&#146;s okay, do you wanna get back together? (imitating Ross)
Yeah, okay. (in her normal voice) Did anyone else hear that?!</p>

<p align="center">Opening Credits</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, the whole gang is there, except for Ross and Rachel. Joey
is trying to eat Chinese with chopsticks and fails miserably. There&#146;s a knock on the
door, and Chandler answers it to reveal Rachel]</p>

<p>Rachel: (softly) Is he here?</p>

<p>Chandler: No.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh. (smiles) Here&#146;s your moisturiser. Hi! </p>

<p>Monica and Phoebe: Hey!</p>

<p>Rachel: You guys are gonna love meee! Okay, check it out, Thursday night, five
tickets, <i>Calvin Klein</i> lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me. (they&#146;re
all silent and look away) Okay, I said that out loud right?</p>

<p>Chandler: Yes, yes, it&#146;s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans
with Ross.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, well okay. Well, there you go.</p>

<p>Phoebe: No, it&#146;s just that he got this new like home theater dealie, and he
wants y'know, us to check it out.</p>

<p>Rachel: Hm-mm.</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah, he&#146;s really excited about it too, he even recorded show
times on his answering machine.</p>

<p>Rachel: Ohh!</p>

<p>Monica: We&#146;re sorry honey.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, it&#146;s okay. (starts to leave)</p>

<p>Joey: Rach, it&#146;s, it&#146;s ah, it&#146;s not that we don&#146;t want to,
really. (quietly) Are we talking models in their underwear?</p>

<p>Rachel: And heels.</p>

<p>Joey: (He turns around to Chandler looking for approval to go with Rachel,
Chandler mouths &#145;Come on!&#146;) (turning back to Rachel) Ross, did ask us first, and
we set that night aside.</p>

<p>Rachel: No, hey, come on, if he asked you first, that&#146;s only fair. (leaves)</p>

<p>[Chandler makes a noise of absolute disgust and heads into the living room.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Ohhh boy, do I feel bad.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>Monica: Very bad.</p>

<p>[We see Chandler lighting up a cigarette.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Chandler what are you doing?!</p>

<p>Monica: Chandler!!</p>

<p>Chandler: (jumps back and points at the cigarette) Oh my God!</p>

<p>Joey: You&#146;re smoking again?!</p>

<p>Chandler: Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, I&#146;m,
I&#146;m smoking still.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?</p>

<p>Chandler: Look, I&#146;m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which
is when I started smoking in the first place.</p>

<p>Monica: Weren&#146;t you nine?!</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeahhh. I&#146;m tellin&#146; ya something, that ah, first smoke after
nap time....</p>

<p>[There&#146;s a knock on the door.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh that&#146;s great, with my luck, that&#146;s gonna be him.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Him? Him, Ross?</p>

<p>Chandler: Nope, hymn 253, His Eyes Are On The Sparrow! When my parents got
divorced is when I started using humour as a defence mechanism. (answers the door and
it&#146;s Rachel again.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi! Uhh, do you guys have plans for the weekend? Because I have my
sister on hold, and she said that we could use her cabin for the weekend and go skiing.
Huh? I&#146;m asking you first, right?!. I mean I&#146;m playing by the rules.</p>

<p>All: Absolutely, yeah!</p>

<p>Rachel: Chandler! You&#146;re smoking? What are you doing?!</p>

<p>Chandler: Hey, shut up!! You&#146;re not my real Mom!!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s, the gang, minus Rachel of course, is there. Chandler is forced to
smoke by an open window.]</p>

<p>Joey: (obviously cold) Hey, can you close that window Chandler? My nipples can
cut glass over here!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Wait. Really?! &#145;Cause mine get me out of tickets.</p>

<p>Ross: Look, you guys I just wanna say, I really, really appreciate you spending
this time with me. It&#146;s been a pretty hard time right now, so I just wanna say
thanks.</p>

<p>Chandler: Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon
okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board? Huh, huh, what do you think? (in an
Irish accent) Two days of darts, it&#146;ll be great!</p>

<p>Joey: It&#146;ll be great for next weekend.</p>

<p>Ross: No, no, no, this weekend guys!</p>

<p>Joey: It&#146;ll be great for next weekend. I mean, (in an Irish accent)
it&#146;ll be grrreat.</p>

<p>Ross: What&#146;s going on?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Well, we were um, sorta invited to go skiing, y'know Rachel&#146;s
sister&#146;s cabin. (Chandler goes back to the window to smoke again.)</p>

<p>Ross: So, for the whole weekend?</p>

<p>Monica: We&#146;re really sorry, but um, she did ask us first.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, that&#146;s okay, I mean if you guys all have to go away for
the first weekend I&#146;m alone by myself, y'know then I totally, totally understand.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Y'know what, I can stay, I&#146;m gonna stay. &#145;Cause the last time
I went skiing I was to afraid to jump off the chair lift, I just went around and around.</p>

<p>Joey: Uh, Pheebs we kinda need you to drive us all up there in your
grandmother&#146;s cab, but y'know what, I&#146;ll stay.</p>

<p>Monica: Noo! I&#146;ll stay. He&#146;s my brother.</p>

<p>Ross: What a pity stay?</p>

<p>Monica: No! We&#146;re gonna have fun. We can make fudge!</p>

<p>Ross: Pity food? Y'know what that&#146;s okay, all right, I don&#146;t need any
of you to stay, okay nobody stays.</p>

<p>Chandler: Well, then, I might as well offer to stay.</p>

<p>[Scene: In Phoebe&#146;s Grandmother&#146;s cab, driving up to the cabin. Phoebe&#146;s
driving, Rachel&#146;s sitting shotgun, Chandler, Monica, and Joey are in the back seat.]</p>

<p>Joey: (to Chandler and Monica) Hey, does anybody else feel bad about Ross?</p>

<p>Monica: Why? Do you think he&#146;s still mad at us?</p>

<p>Chandler: (to Joey) Well he&#146;s probably mad after you called him this
morning to borrow his goggles.</p>

<p>Joey: What? Mine aren&#146;t tinted.</p>

<p>[Chandler starts to light a cigarette.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Chandler!!</p>

<p>Chandler: What?</p>

<p>Phoebe: What does the sign say?</p>

<p>Chandler: Beam me up Jesus.</p>

<p>Phoebe: No, the &#145;No Smoking&#146; sign. There&#146;s no smoking in my
Grandmother&#146;s cab.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom.</p>

<p>All: Oh!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Please!</p>

<p>Monica: No Chandler no! No unscheduled stops. You can go when we stop for gas.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh, come on, there&#146;s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I
really have to goooooooooo.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, now I have to go!!</p>

<p>[Scene: The rest stop, Phoebe&#146;s pulling in.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves.</p>

<p>Monica: What?</p>

<p>[Both Chandler and Joey put their feet up against the glass, Monica doesn&#146;t and
gets thrown up against the glass.]</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay.</p>

<p>Monica: Ow!</p>

<p>[Joey gets out and sprints to the bathroom and Chandler follows with a cigarette in his
hands.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: (to Rachel, who&#146;s staying in the cab.) Aren&#146;t you gonna go?</p>

<p>Rachel: No. Thank you.</p>

<p>Monica: (getting out) No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is &#145;no
tissue, no tuschy.&#146; (Phoebe laughs and gets out.) Well, if everybody&#146;s going.
(She gets out and starts to close the door.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: No, y'know what don&#146;t close it (Rachel slams the door shut locking
themselves out.) &#145;cause the... keys...are in there.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!</p>

<p>Joey: What&#146;s going on?</p>

<p>Chandler: (to Joey) My lighter&#146;s in there! (points to the cab)</p>

<p align="center">Commercial Break</p>

<p>[Scene: The rest stop, the gang is still stuck, Chandler is kneeling at the rear
bumper.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Damn! (stands up) The tailpipe&#146;s not hot enough to light this!</p>

<p>Joey: Relax okay, I-I-I can get this open. Anybody have a coat hanger?</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put
it on this morning.</p>

<p>Monica: So, if you&#146;re parents hadn&#146;t got divorced, you&#146;d be able
to answer a question like a normal person?</p>

<p>Joey: Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys
give me the underwire from your bra!</p>

<p>Monica: What?!</p>

<p>Rachel: What?!</p>

<p>Joey: Come on! Who has the biggest boobs?</p>

<p>Monica: Please!!</p>

<p>Joey: Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the
biggest wire.</p>

<p>The Girls: No, not getting my bra!</p>

<p>Joey: If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay, Monica&#146;s are the biggest.</p>

<p>Monica: These tiny, little non-breasts?! Please, it&#146;s gotta be Rachel.</p>

<p>Rachel: What, no, no, no, mine are deceptively small I mean, I-I-I actually
sometimes, st-stuff my bra.</p>

<p>Monica: All right then, your bra would still be big.</p>

<p>Rachel: No, I stuff outside the bra.</p>

<p>Chandler: Ladies, ladies, let&#146;s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take
off Monica&#146;s bra.</p>

<p>Phoebe: All right, forget it, nevermind, you can have mine.</p>

<p>[Chandler crumples up his cigarette pack and throws it on the ground.]</p>

<p>Rachel: (seeing him) Chandler, what are you doing? There is a trash can right
there.</p>

<p>Chandler: Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and
save us.</p>

<p>Phoebe: (finishing removing her bra) Okay, there.</p>

<p>Joey: Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, now let&#146;s decide who has the nicest ass.</p>

<p>Joey: (opening the door) And there you go!</p>

<p>All: Oh, yeahhhhh!!!</p>

<p>[They all run to get in the cab, and Chandler pulls out a smoke.]</p>

<p>Monica: Chandler!!</p>

<p>Chandler: At least let me smoke it to the good part.</p>

<p>[Phoebe puts the car in gear and starts to back out.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay. (The car moves a few feet and sputters to a stop.) Oh, no!</p>

<p>Rachel: What, what&#146;s it, what&#146;s going on?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, this has happened before.</p>

<p>Rachel: So you know how to fix it?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yep. Put more gas in.</p>

<p>[Scene: Carol and Susan&#146;s, Carol is setting a romantic dinner for Susan as there
is a knock on the door.]</p>

<p>Carol: (answering the door) Hi! </p>

<p>Ross: (entering) Hey.</p>

<p>Carol: Hey, what are you doing here?</p>

<p>Ross: Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you
get the tape that was half the last episode of <em>M*A*S*H</em> and half the hostages
coming home?</p>

<p>Carol: Ah yeah, but now it&#146;s Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming
home.</p>

<p>Ross: Where&#146;s Ben?</p>

<p>Carol: He&#146;s sleeping.</p>

<p>Ross: Ahh. (notices the table) Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?</p>

<p>Carol: Umm, yeah, actually, Susan&#146;s gonna be home any minute, it&#146;s
kinda an anniversary.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?</p>

<p>Carol: It&#146;s not that kind of anniversary.</p>

<p>Ross: Ah! (realises) Oh.</p>

<p>Carol: Sooo!! Anyway...</p>

<p>Ross: Umm, candles, champagne, yeah anniversaries are great. &#145;Cause you
know love lasts forever, y'know. Nothing like it in this lifetime, money in the bank, so
Rachel and I broke up.</p>

<p>Carol: Oh God, Ross I am so sorry.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, well.</p>

<p>Carol: Y'know what, I want to talk to you about this so much, but we should
probably do it when we could really get into it, are you free for dinner tomorrow night?</p>

<p>Ross: Oh yeah, I&#146;d love that.</p>

<p>Carol: Oh, great! Me too.</p>

<p>Ross: I guess it all started when Rachel got this new job. (he sits down at the
table.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The rest stop, Phoebe is on the phone to the motor club.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay, yeah. (to Monica and Rachel) Triple A can pick us up.</p>

<p>Rachel: Great!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, what town are we near?</p>

<p>Monica: Freemont. West-Westmont, ah Westburg?</p>

<p>Phoebe: (to Monica) Then why are you answering? Do you at least know what route
we&#146;re on?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, we are definitely on Route 27.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay. (on phone) We are at a rest stop on Route 27. Okay. (to Rachel)
There is no Route 27. (listens) (to Rachel) Okay, either 93 or 76?</p>

<p>Rachel: I don&#146;t know, I&#146;m sorry, I always slept in the back when we
drove up here.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay. (on phone) Hey, can you send somebody up and down 76 and check
every rest stop, and, and also 93? (listens) Okay! (hangs up) Yeah, no they don&#146;t do
that.</p>

<p>Rachel: Ugh, okay, well somebody will come and save us.</p>

<p>Monica: Who? I mean have you seen a car come by here in the last hour and a
half? I think we should call Ross, maybe he can get a car and come pick us up.</p>

<p>Rachel: No! No, I am not getting in a car with Ross, we will just have to live
here! </p>

<p>Phoebe: But if...</p>

<p>Rachel: No you guys, I am not getting in a car with him, you&#146;ll have to
think of something else.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh good, oh Joey and Chandler are back.</p>

<p>[Joey walks up helping Chandler.]</p>

<p>Monica: So the going for help went well?</p>

<p>Joey: Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.</p>

<p>Chandler: I have the lung capacity of a two year old. (starts to light another
cigarette.)</p>

<p>Monica: Then why are you smoking?</p>

<p>Chandler: Well it&#146;s very unsettling.</p>

<p>[Scene: Carol and Susan&#146;s, Ross is eating the dinner Carol made for Susan.]</p>

<p>Ross: ....right? Right? I mean it&#146;s pretty unbelievable y'know, I mean they
just took off, took off without even looking back. Y'know I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t need
them, huh, I&#146;ve got you guys now as friends, you and Susan.</p>

<p>Carol: Ah, Susan will be so pleased.</p>

<p>[Ross&#146;s beeper goes off.]</p>

<p>Ross: (looking at the page) 717? (to Carol) Where&#146;s 717? (He gets up to
return the page, Carol starts to take the last of the food into the kitchen, but Ross
grabs the last piece.) Hey, you&#146;ve have more of these for Susan right?</p>

<p>Carol: No. But it&#146;s okay, I&#146;ll just put out pickles or something.</p>

<p>[Cut to the rest stop, Monica and Phoebe are waiting anxiously by the phone as it
rings.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: (answering the phone) (whispering) Ross, thank God.</p>

<p>Ross: Pheebs? What, why are you whispering?</p>

<p>Phoebe: I ate a bug.</p>

<p>[Rachel starts to walk up.]</p>

<p>Monica: (running over to stop Rachel) Hey Rach, the tampons here are only a
penny. Let&#146;s stock up. (takes her into the bathroom)</p>

<p>Phoebe: Listen Ross, we ran out of gas, and we don&#146;t know where we are, so
we can&#146;t get a tow truck.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, now you want a favour?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yes, please.</p>

<p>Ross: Well, oh, I&#146;m sorry your car broke down Pheebs, but I&#146;m a little
too busy with some of my real friends right now, but please call to let me know you got
home safely okay?</p>

<p>Carol: (running over and grabbing the phone away from Ross) (on phone) Phoebe,
hang on a second. (Hands Ross her keys) Here, take my car, go pick up your friends.</p>

<p>Ross: No, I&#146;m not gonna pick them up.</p>

<p>Carol: Listen, we both know you&#146;re gonna do it &#145;cause you&#146;re not
a jerk. Okay? So you can either sulk here for a half hour and then go pick them up, or
save us both time and sulk in the car.</p>

<p>Ross: No, Rachel doesn&#146;t want me to....</p>

<p>Carol: Look, I-I-I am sorry that Rachel dumped you &#145;cause she fell in love
with that Mark guy, and you are the innocent victim in all of this, but don&#146;t punish
your friends for what Rachel did to you.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, you&#146;re right.</p>

<p>Carol: (on phone) Phoebe hang on a second Ross wants to say something. (listens)
What? (listens) (to Ross) You slept with someone else?!</p>

<p>Ross: We were on a break!!! Okay!! (grabs the phone) We were, we were..., (calms
down) yeah. Where are you? I&#146;ll find you. (hangs up)</p>

<p>Carol: You slept with another woman?</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, you-you&#146;re-you&#146;re one to talk.</p>

<p>[Scene: The rest stop, Joey is making a sign.]</p>

<p>Joey: Okay, done.</p>

<p>Monica: (reading the sign) What&#146;s &#145;pleh&#146;?</p>

<p>Joey: That&#146;s &#145;help&#146; spelled backwards so that the helicopters can
read it from the air!</p>

<p>Monica: Huh. What&#146;s doofus spelled backwards?</p>

<p>[Ross drives up.]</p>

<p>Rachel: (all excited) Op, op, car! Car!! (sees it&#146;s Ross) Ugh!!!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh, it&#146;s Ross on one of his drives!</p>

<p>Chandler and Joey: Hey!!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hi!</p>

<p>Rachel: What is he doing here?!</p>

<p>Ross: He is saving your butt, ah, unless of course I&#146;m stepping on
some toes here, in which case I can just mosey on, I&#146;ve got plenty of people to help
on the Interstate.</p>

<p>All: No! Come on!</p>

<p>Rachel: All right!! Fine! Fine.</p>

<p>[Ross grabs the gas can he brought along, and walks through Joey&#146;s sign destroying
it.]</p>

<p>Joey: Arrrghh!!</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh no, now it&#146;s not gonna make any sense!</p>

<p>Phoebe: (to Chandler and Monica) You guys, what, what do we do about Ross who
drove all the way up here? What do we do? Just like send him back and we&#146;re then
gonna go skiing?</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh, this is horrible, it&#146;s just horrible.</p>

<p>Joey: Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?</p>

<p>Monica: I know, what about Rachel? I mean how are we even gonna ask her?</p>

<p>Rachel: Ask me what?</p>

<p>Monica: Umm, if ah, it might be okay if Ross came skiing?</p>

<p>Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey: No, I wasn&#146;t gonna ask you that, no.</p>

<p>Rachel: You guys are unbelievable. No! He cannot come.</p>

<p>Ross: Excuse me?</p>

<p>Chandler: It&#146;s horrible.</p>

<p>Ross: (sarcastic) Oh please, can&#146;t I come to your special, magical cabin?</p>

<p>Rachel: Why would you even want to come Ross? You&#146;re a horrible skier.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh-oh, hitting me where it hurts, my ski skills.</p>

<p>Monica: Here we go again.</p>

<p>Joey: I-I can&#146;t handle this, you guys.</p>

<p>Chandler: Y'know what, I can handle it, handle&#146;s my middle name. Actually
it&#146;s the ah, middle part of my first name.</p>

<p>Ross: All right Pheebs, your cab&#146;s ready.</p>

<p>Rachel: All right, let&#146;s go!</p>

<p>Ross: You&#146;re welcome.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, I&#146;m sorry, were you speaking to me or sleeping with someone
else?</p>

<p>Ross: We were on a break!</p>

<p>Rachel: Y'know Ross why don&#146;t you put that on your answering
machine!</p>

<p>Ross: Hey-hey, it&#146;s valid okay? And I&#146;m not the only one who thinks
so, Monica agrees with me.</p>

<p>Rachel: (to Monica) What?!</p>

<p>Monica: (shyly) I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p>Ross: That&#146;s what you said last night.</p>

<p>Monica: What I said was, was that I understood. Joey&#146;s the one who agreed
with you!</p>

<p>Ross: Okay.</p>

<p>Rachel: Really Joey?</p>

<p>Joey: (pause) What?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Y'know what, but there is, there is no right or wrong, here.</p>

<p>Rachel: No, I think it&#146;s very obvious who&#146;s wrong here.</p>

<p>Ross: Obviously not to Joey.</p>

<p>[They all turn around and look at Joey.]</p>

<p>Joey: (pause) What?</p>

<p>[They all start fighting with each other.]</p>

<p>Ross: (to Rachel) Look both, Joey and Monica feel the same way that I do.
No-no-no-no.</p>

<p>Chandler: Guys, guys, guess who I am?! (starts dancing around in an effort to
stop the fighting.)</p>

<p>[They stop briefly to look at Chandler, but then start fighting again.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!! (they all stop fighting, Chandler continues
to dance.) Look what you&#146;re doing to Chandler!! (Chandler finally stops) (to Ross and
Rachel) Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay? (Ross starts
to leave) You don&#146;t, all right you don&#146;t have to love each other, okay? You
don&#146;t, you don&#146;t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you
have to figure out a way to be around each other.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, and not put us in the middle.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, otherwise, I mean that&#146;s, that&#146;s, that&#146;s just it
for us hanging out together. Y'know is that what you want? (they both look away) Can you
be civil?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah.</p>

<p>Ross: I can.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay. Good, all right, let&#146;s get back in the car, &#145;cause
it&#146;s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who&#146;s going
with who?</p>

<p>Ross: Look, you guys, you guys should go. (Joey tries to say something, but Ross
cuts him off.) No, I&#146;m, you, you planned this all out, and I don&#146;t want to ruin
it, so you guys should just go.</p>

<p>Joey: Come on man, you drove all the way up here.</p>

<p>Ross: No, no, really, I&#146;ve got to take the car back anyway, I&#146;m
spending all day tomorrow with Ben, It&#146;s fine, no guilt I promise.</p>

<p>Rachel: Thank you.</p>

<p>Monica: All right, we&#146;ll call you when we get back.</p>

<p>Ross: Okay.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Maybe we can like go to a movie or something. </p>

<p>Ross: Okay.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Or, or the rodeo!!</p>

<p>Ross: That would be great.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay!</p>

<p>Chandler: I was being Shelly Winters from <i>The Poseidon Adventure</i>.</p>

<p>Ross: I know!</p>

<p>[They all get in the cab and drive away.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Bye!!!</p>

<p>[Ross tries to start the truck, and discovers the battery&#146;s dead.]</p>

<p align="center">Closing Credits</p>

<p>[Scene: Carol and Susan&#146;s, Carol is running to answer the door.]</p>

<p>Carol: (looking through the peephole) Ugh. (opening the door) Ross!</p>

<p>Ross: (entering) Hi! Sorry I&#146;m late. Were you sleeping?</p>

<p>Carol: Ahh, nooo!!</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, great! Listen, oh I had to get you a whole new battery. I got you the
best one I could, &#145;cause that&#146;s not where you want to skimp.</p>

<p>Carol: You&#146;re a genius, Ross.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, well it came to about $112, but what the hell, just call it an even
110?</p>

<p>Carol: Okay, I&#146;ll pay you tomorrow. (pushes him out the door)</p>

<p>Ross: Okay.</p>

<p>Carol: Okay, bye!!</p>

<p>Ross: So they ah, they all took off, it was pretty hard watching them go,
y'know?</p>

<p>Carol: Yeah, okay, bye. (closes the door, turns out the lights, and runs back to
the bedroom)</p>

<p>Ross: (outside the door) So I&#146;m gonna take off then!</p>
