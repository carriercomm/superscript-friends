<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is there eating breakfast. Chandler is cleaning
out his wallet.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey! New wallet, huh?</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just
doesn&#146;t say &#145;cool&#146; anymore.</p>

<p>Monica: Rachel!</p>

<p>Rachel: What?</p>

<p>Monica: You just put an empty carton back in the fridge!</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh yeah, I know, but the garbage was full.</p>

<p>Monica: Have you ever taken out the trash? (Hands her the garbage.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, I thought you liked doing it. (Rachel starts out the door
and stops.)</p>

<p>Monica: Third door on the left.</p>

<p>Rachel: Right!</p>

<p>[Scene: Garbage room: Mr. Treeger is unclogging the trash chute as Rachel enters.]</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh! Hey, Mr. Treeger.</p>

<p>Mr. Treeger:: Hey.</p>

<p>(Rachel opens the trash chute, winces at the smell, and throws the garbage bag in. She
then tries to throw the pizza box in, but since it&#146;s so big she jams it into the
opening and it prevents the door from closing. She then turns around too see Mr. Treeger
watching her.)</p>

<p>Mr. Treeger:: What are you doing?</p>

<p>Rachel: Ummm. Oh! I&#146;m sorry. (She grabs the box and offers him a piece.)
It&#146;s a little old but&#133;</p>

<p>Mr. Treeger:: No! You&#146;re clogging up the chute that I spent a half-hour
unclogging!</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m sorry. I didn&#146;t&#151;I don&#146;t come in here a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. Treeger:: Oh yeah, of course you don&#146;t!</p>

<p>Rachel: No.</p>

<p>Mr. Treeger:: &#145;Cause you&#146;re a little princess! &quot;Daddy, buy me a
pizza. Daddy, buy me a candy factory. Daddy, make the cast of <em>Cats</em> sing Happy
Birthday to me&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>Rachel: I didn&#146;t&#133; I never said that.</p>

<p>Mr. Treeger:: You think you could make a mess and the big man in coveralls will
come in here and clean it up, huh? Well, why don&#146;t think of someone else for a
change?</p>

<p>Rachel: (starting to cry) Okay, I&#146;m sorry. (Runs out still carrying the
pizza box.)</p>

<p>[Cut to Monica and Rachel&#146;s apartment as Rachel returns in tears.]</p>

<p>Monica: God! If you&#146;re gonna cry about it! (She grabs the box and goes to
through it out.]</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Continued from earlier, Rachel is now telling everyone of
her experience in the garbage room.]</p>

<p>Joey: Whoa-whoa, Treeger made you cry?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yes! And he said really mean things that were only partly true. </p>

<p>Joey: I&#146;m gonna go down there and teach that guy a lesson.</p>

<p>Monica: Joey, please don&#146;t do that. I think it&#146;s best that we just
forget about it.</p>

<p>Rachel: That&#146;s easy for you to say, you weren&#146;t almost just killed.</p>

<p>Joey: All right that&#146;s it, school is in session! (Exits and slams the
door.)</p>

<p>Monica: (Picking up a card from Chandler&#146;s wallet.) My God! Is this a gym
card?</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but I&#146;ve
missed the last 1200 times.</p>

<p>Ross: So why don&#146;t you quit?</p>

<p>Chandler: You don&#146;t think I&#146;ve tried? You think I like having
50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down
there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they
bring out Maria.</p>

<p>Ross: Who is Maria?</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh Maria. You can&#146;t say no to her, she&#146;s like this lycra
spandex covered gym&#133;treat.</p>

<p>Ross: You need me to go down there with you and hold your hand?</p>

<p>Chandler: No!</p>

<p>Ross: So you&#146;re strong enough to face her on your own?</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh no, you&#146;ll have to come.</p>

<p>[Scene: Treeger&#146;s apartment, Joey knocks on the door and Treeger opens it.]</p>

<p>Mr. Treeger:: Tribbiani! Hold on, I&#146;ll get the plunger.</p>

<p>Joey: Hey! You hold on pal! Now you made my friend, Rachel, cry. So now,
you&#146;re gonna go up there and apologize to her, unless you want me to call the
landlord.</p>

<p>Mr. Treeger:: And tell him what?</p>

<p>Joey: Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.</p>

<p>Mr. Treeger:: Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act
of 1968!</p>

<p>Joey: I have actually not heard of that.</p>

<p>Mr. Treeger:: Yeah, well your friends are in violation of it. I&#146;ve been a
nice guy up until now, but uh, I don&#146;t need this grief. I&#146;m gonna call the
landlord and tell him that Monica is illegally subletting here grandmother&#146;s
apartment. Your friends are outta here pal.</p>

<p>Joey: Why don&#146;t you tell me something I don&#146;t know! (He storms out,
and once Treeger closes the door behind him, Joey makes an &#145;Oops!&#146; have.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, everyone is still eating
breakfast.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh please, somebody tell me I don&#146;t have to go to work today!</p>

<p>Monica: What&#146;s the matter?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh, my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy, and every
time I see him I just want to do things to him that I&#146;m not allowed to charge for.</p>

<p>Monica: So do them for free.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh no, it is forbidden! No-no, Mrs. Potter fires people for fooling
around with clients. And it&#146;s against my oath as a masseuse.</p>

<p>Ross: They make you take an oath?</p>

<p>Phoebe: No, I made myself take an oath. Yeah, no fooling around with clients and
umm, always be prepared. Yeah, that one&#146;s actually from the Boy Scouts, but it just
makes good sense.</p>

<p>Chandler: Why don&#146;t you just give him to somebody else?</p>

<p>Phoebe: No, I can handle it. No, I&#146;m a professional. (She starts to leave)</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh Pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?</p>

<p>Monica: Wow! And you got a petticure. Your feet are all dressed up.</p>

<p>Chandler: Because that&#146;s the only part of you he can see when he&#146;s on
the table!</p>

<p>Monica: You&#146;re gonna do some feet flirtin&#146;!</p>

<p>Phoebe: I don&#146;t what your talking about. (Laughs nervously and continues to
leaqve)</p>

<p>Ross: Then how do you explain the toe ring?!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Because it&#146;s Arabian princess day at work! Okay?! Leave me alone!</p>

<p>[Cut to later, Joey is returning from talking to Mr. Treeger.]</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh! My hero! What happened?</p>

<p>Joey: Well uh, I went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like
that and that he&#146;d better come up here and apologize. I&#146;ll see you later.
(Starts to leave)</p>

<p>Monica: What a minute, what did he say?</p>

<p>Joey: He said that he wasn&#146;t gonna apologize because you guys are living
here illegally, so instead what he&#146;s gonna do is have you evicted&#151;I&#146;ll see
you later.</p>

<p>Rachel: What?! You got us evicted!!</p>

<p>Monica: I told you not to go down there!</p>

<p>Joey: Well he made Rachel cry!</p>

<p>Monica: Rachel always cries!</p>

<p>Rachel: That&#146;s not true! (Starts to cry.)</p>

<p>Monica: Now Joey, you go down there and you suck up to him. I mean you suck like
you&#146;ve never sucked before!</p>

<p>Joey: All right! I&#146;ll try! But if I can&#146;t, you can stay with Chandler
and I until you get settled.</p>

<p>Rachel: Go!!</p>

<p>Joey: All right, all right, all right. (Starts to leave, stops, and turns
around) I mean I&#146;ll have to check with him first, but I&#146;ll think he&#146;ll be
cool with it. (Monica shoos him out.)</p>

<p>Mr. Treeger:: Yeah, but y&#146;know, I think the reason we&#146;re not getting
that spin right is because my apartment&#146;s too small.</p>

<p>Joey: Look, you wanna use our place?</p>

<p>Mr. Treeger:: No, I ahh, had another idea.</p>
