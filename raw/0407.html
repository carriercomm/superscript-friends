<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey and Chandler are there eating
breakfast.]</p>

<p>Chandler: (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy
naked! It was like torture!</p>

<p>Ross: Y'know if we ever go to war and you&#146;re captured, you&#146;re in for a
<strong>big</strong> surprise.</p>

<p>Chandler: It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean it&#146;s bad
enough that I&#146;m in love with my roommates girlfriend&#151;which by the way, I think
she knows. Because every time we&#146;re in the room together there&#146;s this weird like
energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen
her naked. I mean at least when I&#146;ve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her
body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, she&#146;s smooth!
Smooth! (leaves)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>Phoebe: Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?</p>

<p>All: Yeah! Oh my God!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is getting a phone number from a woman (Casey) as Chandler
watches from the doorway.]</p>

<p>Casey: Here you go.</p>

<p>Joey: Great! All right, so I&#146;ll call you later.</p>

<p>Casey: Great! (leaves)</p>

<p>Chandler: (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?</p>

<p>Joey: That would be Casey. We&#146;re going out tonight.</p>

<p>Chandler: Goin&#146; out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So
things didn&#146;t work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.</p>

<p>Joey: No, things are fine with Kathy. I&#146;m having a late dinner with her
tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.</p>

<p>Chandler: (shocked) What?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by
myself! (Laughs)</p>

<p>Chandler: Wait! You&#146;re going out with Kathy!</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?</p>

<p>Chandler: Well, I&#146;m upset&#151;for you. I mean, having sex with an endless
line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He can&#146;t believe he just
sad that.)</p>

<p>Joey: What is the big deal? It&#146;s not like we&#146;re exclusive.</p>

<p>Chandler: Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But
Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that
she&#146;s-she&#146;s smart, and funny, and gets you.</p>

<p>Joey: You got all that from the back of her head?</p>

<p>Chandler: All right look, I think it&#146;s time for you to settle down. Y'know?
Make a choice, pick a lane.</p>

<p>Joey: Who&#146;s Elaine?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Monica are sitting on the couch playing cards,
and Phoebe is working on a new song.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: (singing) &quot;<em>Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair.
Swinging with the greatest of ease&#133;</em>&quot; Darn it! Now, I don&#146;t know who to
get to the next verse.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, you could just go uh, &quot;<em>greatest of ease</em>&#133; (plays air
guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn.&quot; Then go right into it.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about
&#145;bah-bah-bha-bhan?&#146;</p>

<p>Ross: Well umm, y&#146;know, I used to play.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh yeah, that&#146;s right, the keyboards, huh?</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in
college. I mean that&#146;s-that&#146;s when I really found my sound.</p>

<p>(Monica is taking a drink as Ross says that, laughs, and snorts her drink.)</p>

<p>Monica: Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth
it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah.</p>

<p>Monica: He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every
allowed to hear, &quot;The Sound.&quot;</p>

<p>Phoebe: I wanna hear &quot;The Sound.&quot;</p>

<p>Ross: Really? No. I mean, nah, I haven&#146;t played in so long, and-and, well
it&#146;s-it&#146;s really personal stuff, y&#146;know?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Come on, play that funky music white boy.</p>

<p>Monica: Yeah!</p>

<p>Ross: No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up in&#151;No, yeah,
okay. (Runs out.)</p>

<p>[Cut to later that same day, Ross has retrieved his keyboard and is about to debut,
&quot;The Sound.&quot;]</p>

<p>Ross: Okay, guys.</p>

<p>Chandler: All right! Bring it on, you&#133;</p>

<p>Ross: Here we go. (Plays one note) Y&#146;know, I&#146;ve-I&#146;ve never played
my stuff for anyone before, so it&#146;s important that-that you understand it&#146;s
about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Y&#146;know, umm, you
should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. That&#146;s what
I&#146;m&#133;</p>

<p>Chandler: (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!</p>

<p>(Ross starts to play. He plays a key that has a back beat sound attached to it. Over
the background music he plays the sound of a barking dog, a mooing cow, a laser beam,
someone coughing, a jackhammer, a doorbell, a police siren, a ray gun, breaking dishes,
and for a closer he plays the sound of a loud crash. Basically, the music sucks.)</p>

<p>Monica: (At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, umm&#133; terrific.</p>

<p>Chandler: Really, bitchin&#146;!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Wow, it was so&#151;wow!</p>

<p>Ross: Really?! I mean, really?!!</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!</p>

<p>Ross: Wow! Thanks, you guys. That&#146;s uh&#151;ohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you
another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. I&#146;ll be
right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, I&#146;m&#151;I am so&#133;
(starts to break up and leaves)</p>

<p>Monica: Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, I can&#146;t believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.</p>

<p>Phoebe: What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus
it&#146;s just, it&#146;s so different from the stuff you usually hear.</p>

<p>Chandler: You mean like, music?</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching Yasmein Bleeth running on TV, and the
duck starts quacking.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah, I know what you&#146;re thinkin&#146;! Yes, yes, your breasts
are just as firm and juicy.</p>

<p>(There&#146;s a knock on the door.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Come in!</p>

<p>Kathy: (entering) Hey! (sees what&#146;s on TV) Oh God, is that <em>Baywatch</em>?</p>

<p>Chandler: Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.</p>

<p>Kathy: So is Joey around?</p>

<p>Chandler: No-no, he&#146;s not back yet, but he&#146;ll be here any minute. So
uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?</p>

<p>Kathy: I uh, don&#146;t really have a preference. You?</p>

<p>Chandler: I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) &#133;of the
boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.</p>

<p>Joey: (on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, it&#146;s me. Listen Casey and I
were on our way back and had a little car trouble.</p>

<p>Chandler: What happened?</p>

<p>Joey: We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some
transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I&#146;ll be there as
soon as I can.</p>

<p>Chandler: Why can&#146;t you tell her?</p>

<p>Joey: &#145;Cause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about
to&#151;(he stops talking suddenly)</p>

<p>Chandler: Joey! Joey!!</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah?</p>

<p>Chandler: I thought your time ran out.</p>

<p>Joey: Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of more&#151;(his time runs out for
real)</p>

<p>Chandler: (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. He&#146;s running a little late, he
says he&#146;s sorry.</p>

<p>Kathy: Oh.</p>

<p>Chandler: So I guess it&#146;s just uh, you and me then.</p>

<p>Kathy: Oh, okay.</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah, I think it is!</p>

<p>Kathy: So what did you do today?</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut&#133;</p>

<p>Kathy: (interrupting) Oh, it looks great!</p>

<p>Chandler: &#133;and then it got canceled.</p>

<p>Kathy: Well, I could cut it.</p>

<p>Chandler: Really?! You do that?</p>

<p>Kathy: Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my aunt&#146;s dog grooming shop, but
hey, what do you say?</p>

<p>Chandler: Dog grooming huh? Okay, just don&#146;t make my tail too poofy.</p>

<p>[Cut to later, Kathy is cutting Chandler&#146;s hair.]</p>

<p>Kathy: You have really great hair.</p>

<p>Chandler: Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through
his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Y&#146;know who also has
great hair is Joey!</p>

<p>Kathy: Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, I&#146;m basically done here. Just
let me get this off your neck.</p>

<p>(Kathy leans in really close and Chandler mouths &quot;Oh my God.&quot; She moves
around in front of him and kneels at his feet.)</p>

<p>Chandler: What-what &#145;cha doin&#146;?</p>

<p>Kathy: Checking to see if it&#146;s even.</p>

<p>Chandler: &#145;Kay.</p>

<p>Kathy: Looks good.</p>

<p>(They lean in to kiss and are interrupted by the phone.)</p>

<p>Chandler: (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phone&#146;s making
sounds! (On phone) Hello!</p>

<p>Joey: (on phone) Hey dude, it&#146;s me.</p>

<p>Chandler: Hey it&#146;s Joey!</p>

<p>Joey: Listen uh, I&#146;m really sorry, it looks like I&#146;m gonna be stuck
here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the
transmission wasn&#146;t there!</p>

<p>Chandler: What?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, it must&#146;ve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit
a dog.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay.</p>

<p>Joey: Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)</p>

<p>Kathy: (on phone) Hey. (listens) Oh no it&#146;s fine, don&#146;t worry about
it. (listens) Yeah-no, stop apologizing, it&#146;s okay. (listens) Yeah! I&#146;ll talk to
you tomorrow. (hangs up) (to Chandler) I should uh, probably go.</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah. Yes! Yeah. </p>

<p>(Kathy leaves and Chandler groans in agony. Kathy knocks on the door and Chandler opens
it.)</p>

<p>Kathy: I forgot my purse.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh. </p>

<p>(They kiss, passionately.)</p>

<p>Kathy: No, I really did forget my purse.</p>

<p>(They kiss again.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, continued from earlier. Chandler and Kathy are still
kissing, then they stop suddenly.]</p>

<p>Chandler: No-no-no-no, this is bad! It&#146;s bad! This is bad!</p>

<p>Kathy: Horrible!</p>

<p>Chandler: Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?</p>

<p>Kathy: No-no-no, the kiss was good.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay!</p>

<p>Kathy: No, but that&#146;s bad!</p>

<p>Chandler: Ooh! Yes! Okay! Here&#146;s what we do, we-we forget it happened.</p>

<p>Kathy: What?!</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means we&#146;re unhappy
forever. Sound good?</p>

<p>Kathy: Can you really do that?</p>

<p>Chandler: I have to; he&#146;s my best friend, and you&#146;re seeing him.</p>

<p>Kathy: Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with you&#133;</p>

<p>Chandler: (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Don&#146;t! Don&#146;t! See-see,
you&#146;re getting me confused, I&#146;m starting to urn. </p>

<p>Kathy: I&#146;m sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.</p>

<p>Chandler: I-I think we have too.</p>

<p>Kathy: Okay. Bye.</p>

<p>Chandler: Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against
the door.) Are you still out there?</p>

<p>Kathy: (outside the door) No. (Chandler opens the door and they kiss again.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is performing, his music hasn&#146;t improved.]</p>

<p>Ross: (His voice is altered to sound like a computer.) Electrifying. (He plays
the sound of a ticking clock.) Emphatic time-time-time&#133;</p>

<p>Monica: (to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, there&#146;s a <em>Starbucks</em> about
three blocks down.</p>

<p>Phoebe: (pushing Monica back onto the couch) It&#146;s so inspired! Look at him!
Look at him go!</p>

<p>[cut back to Ross who finally finishes his so-called song with the same crash from
before. He gets some applause, mainly &#145;cause he&#146;s done.]</p>

<p>Ross: (with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guys&#133;</p>

<p>Monica: (to Phoebe) Hey, aren&#146;t you up next?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh no, I&#146;m not playing tonight.</p>

<p>Rachel: Why not?</p>

<p>Phoebe: I can&#146;t follow Ross! It&#146;d be like those bicycle ridding chimps
that followed <em>The Beetles</em>. No.</p>

<p>Monica: Phoebe, Ross sucks! </p>

<p>Rachel: Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh my God, he&#146;s not even appreciated in his own time. I would give
anything to not be appreciated in my own time!</p>

<p>(Rachel and Monica look at each other, and agree on something without saying anything.)</p>

<p>Monica: Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, Phoebe you&#146;re&#133; awful!</p>

<p>Phoebe: You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is opening the door, but Chandler has the chain on
it.]</p>

<p>Joey: Aww man! I can&#146;t believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the
door.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to
reveal a fully furnished apartment.)</p>

<p>Joey: (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?</p>

<p>Chandler: I sure did.</p>

<p>Joey: Why?</p>

<p>Chandler: Well, I just thought it&#146;d make me feel good to do something nice
for my friend.</p>

<p>Joey: Well, you&#146;re amazing.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh no-no-no. <strong>This</strong> is amazing. (He goes over and
presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing
the TV.)</p>

<p>Joey: (very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! That&#146;s the dream!
Man, how did you afford this stuff?</p>

<p>Chandler: Well, y&#146;know I&#146;m 29. I mean who needs a savings account.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh, I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey
listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, I&#146;m
gonna do that.</p>

<p>Chandler: You mean with Casey.</p>

<p>Joey: No-no-no, I think I&#146;m gonna see how things go with Kathy. She&#146;s
pretty cool.</p>

<p>Chandler: Or Casey.</p>

<p>Joey: No-no, Kathy.</p>

<p>Chandler: Could be Casey.</p>

<p>Joey: No. No, Kathy.</p>

<p>Chandler: Consider Casey.</p>

<p>Joey: Y&#146;know what I think? I think somebody&#146;s got a little crush on
Casey. How &#145;bout I fix you two up? What do you think?</p>

<p>Chandler: That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross has just finished playing.]</p>

<p>Ross: (to Phoebe) Hey!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you don&#146;t want to
play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>Ross: Pheebs&#133;</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, I-I can&#146;t&#151;I mean y&#146;know I was trying to be really
y'know okay and upbeat about it, I just&#151;I feel so dwarfed by your musical gift.
I&#133;</p>

<p>Ross: See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.
Y&#146;know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then I&#133;
I won&#146;t play anymore.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh no. No-no-no, don&#146;t do that! How could I live with myself if I
knew I was depriving the world of your music.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, okay.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Monica are sitting on the couch and Phoebe is getting
coffee as Chandler enters. Ross is also there.]</p>

<p>Ross: Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.</p>

<p>Monica: Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!</p>

<p>Chandler: I kissed Kathy.</p>

<p>Ross: What?</p>

<p>Monica: Are you serious?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Does Joey know?</p>

<p>Chandler: No. Is there anyway, <strong>anyway</strong> you think he&#146;ll
understand this?</p>

<p>Monica: You obviously haven&#146;t screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all
look at her) Which we all appreciate.</p>

<p>Ross: No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you
kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just would&#146;ve just stepped aside.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh, don&#146;t say that! Don&#146;t say that. That&#146;s not true. Is
it?</p>

<p>Phoebe: I think maybe, yeah.</p>

<p>Monica: He loves you.</p>

<p>Chandler: Then why didn&#146;t you tell me to do that?!!</p>

<p>Ross: Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah! No, that&#146;s right. And I thought it was a really good idea.</p>

<p>Rachel: I know, I remember that!</p>

<p>Monica: I remember you did.</p>

<p>Chandler: God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, Chandler, you&#146;re gonna have to tell him.</p>

<p>Chandler: Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!</p>

<p>Rachel: Because you do.</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah, I know.</p>

<p>Ross: Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.</p>

<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching TV as Chandler enters.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Hey!</p>

<p>Joey: Hey! Samboucha Margarita? </p>

<p>Chandler: Is that a real thing?</p>

<p>Joey: Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.</p>

<p>Chandler: Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.</p>

<p>Joey: What&#146;s up?</p>

<p>Chandler: It&#146;s-it&#146;s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot
actually.</p>

<p>Joey: You do?</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah.</p>

<p>Joey: Well, you&#146;re timing couldn&#146;t be better. She&#146;s not my
girlfriend anymore.</p>

<p>Chandler: What?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, she broke up with me.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh uh, when?</p>

<p>Joey: Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind
of scene, that&#146;s why I let people watch.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?</p>

<p>Joey: Well, I&#146;ve been better. But, I&#146;m all right. So you like her huh?</p>

<p>Chandler: Yes, but I-I uh, don&#146;t have too.</p>

<p>Joey: No-no-no, no it&#146;s uh, it&#146;s okay.</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah. You know why? &#145;Cause you came to me first.</p>

<p>Chandler: Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.</p>

<p>Joey: But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you&#146;re work cut out
for you. &#145;Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she&#146;s into
some other guy. So&#133;</p>

<p>Chandler: See uh, that&#146;s-that&#146;s actually what I wanted to talk to you
about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.</p>

<p>Joey: Who?</p>

<p>Chandler: It&#146;s me. I&#146;m the other guy.</p>

<p>Joey: What?</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to
talking, and one thing to another and&#133;</p>

<p>Joey: And what?! Did you sleep with her?!</p>

<p>Chandler: No! No! No! I just kissed her.</p>

<p>Joey: What?!! That&#146;s even worse!!</p>

<p>Chandler: How is that worse?!</p>

<p>Joey: I don&#146;t know! But it&#146;s the same!</p>

<p>Chandler: Look, I&#146;m sorry! But there&#146;s nothing I can do, I think
I&#146;m in love with her!</p>

<p>Joey: Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!</p>

<p>Chandler: You&#146;re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.</p>

<p>Joey: Over the line?! You-you&#146;re-you&#146;re so far past the line, that
you-you can&#146;t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!</p>

<p>Chandler: Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!</p>

<p>Joey: Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like
&quot;Well, kinda.&quot;) Well, y&#146;know what I will not watch your TV, I will not
listen to your stereo, and there&#146;s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that
I&#146;m not gonna eat! You know why?!</p>

<p>Chandler: Probably because&#133;</p>

<p>Joey: Because it&#146;s all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this
apartment is empty for me! And I&#146;m not happy about you either. (The bread maker
dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom
and slams the door.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Closing Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is playing his music. Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting
on the couch.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh my God, he&#146;s lost it. He&#146;s totally lost it.</p>

<p>Monica: (removing ear plugs) What?</p>

<p>Rachel: Phoebe, his music could not <strong>get</strong> any worse. There are
rats in the basement that are hanging themselves.</p>

<p>(Ross finally finishes with the same crash, and gets some applause.)</p>

<p>Ross: Thank you, thanks. (Sits down next to the girls) Yeah, I lost it.
Y&#146;know, I&#146;m not gonna play anymore, (to Phoebe) would you, can you finish my
set?</p>

<p>Phoebe: After that? Yeah! No, I mean if I can help.</p>

<p>(Phoebe gets up and goes to play, Ross goes over and sits down next to Monica and
Rachel.)</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, like I could <strong>lose</strong> it.</p>

<p>Rachel: What?</p>

<p>Ross: I played bad on purpose guys.</p>

<p>(Both Monica and Rachel laugh.)</p>

<p>Monica: Okay, so you were trying to play bad this whole time.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah&#151;no, just that last song.</p>
