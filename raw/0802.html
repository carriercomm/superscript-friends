<p>[Scene: The Hotel Lobby, Rachel and Phoebe are at the front desk checking out.]</p>

<p>Rachel: Listen y&#146;know what sir? For the last time, I don&#146;t care what
the computer says, we did not take a bag of Mashuga nuts from the mini-bar and we did not
watch Dr. Do-Me-A-Little!</p>

<p>Joey: (entering) Hey!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?</p>

<p>Joey: No. (Phoebe grabs the receipt and shows it to Joey who gets mad.) I was
told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!</p>

<p>(Chandler and Monica enter.)</p>

<p>Chandler: (to the front desk clerk) Hi! We&#146;re checking out of the bridal
suite.</p>

<p>Monica: (depressed) That&#146;s right. I&#146;m no longer a bride. I&#146;ll
never be a bride again. Now, I&#146;m just someone&#146;s wife!</p>

<p>Chandler: And I&#146;m the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down
in a huff.) Oh honey, come on don&#146;t be upset. We still have so much to look forward
to!</p>

<p>Monica: Oh yeah, right. (Rolls her eyes.)</p>

<p>Chandler: We got the honeymoon.</p>

<p>Monica: That&#146;s not &#145;til Thursday.</p>

<p>Chandler: The wedding pictures?</p>

<p>Monica: They won&#146;t be ready for weeks.</p>

<p>Chandler: Not the disposable cameras from the tables.</p>

<p>Monica: That&#146;s true! (Happily) I knew I married you for a reason!</p>

<p>Chandler: I&#146;ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go
home.</p>

<p>Monica: Okay.</p>

<p>(Joey giggles.)</p>

<p>Chandler: What? What did you take a picture of?</p>

<p>Joey: Nothing! It was something.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?</p>

<p>Rachel: Are you joking? Check out is not &#145;til noon and he has a good
(checks her watch) eleven minutes left.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh.</p>

<p>Monica: Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got
so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until y&#146;know, he screamed out <i>Radisson</i>
at the end.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, well I&#146;m gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them
developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. You&#146;re 32! (Exits)</p>

<p>Front Desk Clerk: (To Monica) Here&#146;s a copy of your bill.</p>

<p>Monica: Oh thanks. (Reading the bill) Champagne, strawberries&#133;Oh my God! I
can&#146;t believe Chandler ordered porn on our wedding night!</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, that&#146;s sad. Mashuga nut?</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s Hotel Room, he is letting Chandler in.]</p>

<p>Ross: Hi.</p>

<p>Chandler: Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps?
Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?</p>

<p>Ross: Why not? It&#146;s built into the price of the room.</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah but you don&#146;t need&#151;(Picks up something)&#151;What is
this?</p>

<p>Ross: Thread!</p>

<p>Chandler: Score! Where are the disposable cameras?</p>

<p>Ross: What disposable cameras?</p>

<p>Chandler: The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?</p>

<p>Ross: No you didn&#146;t.</p>

<p>Chandler: Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I
said&#133;</p>

<p>Ross: Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and
my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, &quot;Why do
they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?&quot; (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did
that.</p>

<p>Chandler: So you don&#146;t have the cameras?!</p>

<p>Ross: No. Sorry man.</p>

<p>Chandler: So? What? What? They&#146;re gone! Monica&#146;s gonna freak!</p>

<p>Ross: Well, I&#146;m sure they&#146;re still somewhere here in the hotel.
I&#146;ll-I&#146;ll help you look for them.</p>

<p>Chandler: Great.</p>

<p>Ross: In-in three minutes.</p>

<p>(Chandler goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and then opens it again right away.
Ross looks up and hands him the toilet paper Ross already packed.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe is entering to see Monica sitting in front of a
mound of wedding gifts.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey!</p>

<p>Monica: Hey!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?</p>

<p>Monica: No! (Pause) But, they&#146;re callin&#146; out to me! I mean this little
guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldn&#146;t
mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?</p>

<p>Phoebe: A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old
woman.</p>

<p>(Monica opens it anyways.)</p>

<p>Monica: A tiny salt shaker!!!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!</p>

<p>Monica: Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh yeah.</p>

<p>Monica: Good. Okay, I&#146;m just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of
them.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay.</p>

<p>Monica: Whew. Although y&#146;know, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I
mean&#133; I guess y&#146;know it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Well I guess it&#146;s okay to open one more if it&#146;s part of a set.
Y&#146;know, it&#146;s probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)</p>

<p>Monica: Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)</p>

<p>Rachel: (entering) Hi.</p>

<p>Monica: Hey, how are you feelin&#146;? Any morning sickness?</p>

<p>Rachel: Shh-shh-shh! The guys don&#146;t know yet do they?</p>

<p>Monica: No! Joey and Ross don&#146;t know anything and Chandler still thinks
that Phoebe&#146;s pregnant.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah that&#146;s right Chandler does still think I&#146;m pregnant. He
hasn&#146;t asked me how I&#146;m feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for
the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.</p>

<p>Rachel: Don&#146;t worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a
few more hours, &#145;cause I&#146;m going to tell the father today.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first
floor?</p>

<p>Rachel: Ew! No!</p>

<p>Phoebe: What?! I think he&#146;s cute.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well then you have his baby.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Believe me I&#146;m trying.</p>

<p>Monica: Wow. Y&#146;know it is so weird. I mean, you&#146;re gonna tell this guy
today and he has no idea what&#146;s gonna happen.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah. You&#146;re just gonna knock on his door and change his life
forever. You&#146;re like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual
magnetism.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Pretty big? It&#146;s huge! God, this guy doesn&#146;t have a clue!
He&#146;s just walking down the street thinking, &#145;I had sex with Rachel Green. I
rock!&#146; then bam! He&#146;s a father and everything&#146;s different.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well it&#146;s only different if he wants it to be. I mean, I&#146;m not
gonna ask him for anything.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now he&#146;s
walking around thinking, &#145;Do I want to be a dad?&#146; and then bam!</p>

<p>Monica: What was that bam?</p>

<p>Phoebe: I don&#146;t. He got&#133;he-he-he-he&#146;s hit by a bus.</p>

<p>Joey: (entering) Hey!</p>

<p>Rachel: Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that
she was pregnant?</p>

<p>Joey: (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have
an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that
Sunglass Hut!</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh Joey! Joey! No, it&#146;s not you! You didn&#146;t get anybody
pregnant!</p>

<p>Joey: Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.)
Is somebody pregnant?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh yeah. That&#146;s me.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh my God Pheebs! You&#146;re gonna have a baby?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, I&#146;m gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe
hug.)</p>

<p>Joey: Whoa, wait a minute. Who&#146;s the father?</p>

<p>Phoebe: You don&#146;t know him. It&#146;s not important. He wants nothing to do
with me or the baby. (She sits down like she&#146;s pregnant.)</p>

<p>Joey: Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? &#145;Cause I will track him down
and kick his ass!</p>

<p>Phoebe: David Lynn.</p>

<p>Joey: David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! (Exits)</p>

<p>Monica: Who&#146;s David Lynn?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Banquet Room, Chandler is under one of the tables as Ross enters.]</p>

<p>Ross: Chandler?</p>

<p>Chandler: Hey! Did you find the cameras?</p>

<p>Ross: No. Did you?</p>

<p>Chandler: Yes! And that&#146;s why I&#146;m under the table. Celebrating.</p>

<p>Ross: Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager,
no-one&#146;s turned them.</p>

<p>Chandler: Well this is great. Y&#146;know, those cameras were the only thing
that was gonna cheer Monica up today, she&#146;s really depressed.</p>

<p>Ross: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?</p>

<p>Chandler: All my energy is going into not asking that question. I can&#146;t
believe I screwed this up!</p>

<p>Ross: I&#146;m sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Here&#146;s
a thought. This is the same ballroom. There&#146;s a band. There&#146;s gonna be plenty of
dressed up people.</p>

<p>Chandler: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?</p>

<p>Ross: No-no-no, I&#146;m saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at
the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make
sure not to get anybody else&#146;s faces.</p>

<p>Chandler: Are you serious?</p>

<p>Ross: I&#146;m just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you
really want to start your life together by letting her down?</p>

<p>Chandler: Marriage advice? Really?!</p>

<p>Ross: I&#146;m telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Aren&#146;t
these the same flowers?</p>

<p>Chandler: I don&#146;t know, Monica picked out the flowers.</p>

<p>Ross: What about the chairs?</p>

<p>Chandler: She picked those out too.</p>

<p>Ross: How about the place settings?</p>

<p>Chandler: That was her.</p>

<p>Ross: What did you do?</p>

<p>Chandler: I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?</p>

<p>Ross: Hmm. (They head off to the gift shop.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is sitting on the couch as Phoebe enters.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey! Ooh, did you do it yet?</p>

<p>Rachel: Not yet.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh, well what are you doing here? Are you about to do it? (Gasps) Is it
Gunther?</p>

<p>Rachel: No! Phoebe, it&#146;s not Gunther.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Thank God, &#145;cause that hair on a baby&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: Phoebe the father is not here okay? I haven&#146;t told him yet and I
don&#146;t think I can tell him at all now!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Why not?</p>

<p>Rachel: I don&#146;t know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking,
&#145;I&#146;m gonna tell the father today&#146; and then bam!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Bus?</p>

<p>Rachel: No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all
is!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Well-well but it is huge.</p>

<p>Rachel: I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I
didn&#146;t even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.</p>

<p>Phoebe: You&#146;re thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it
over with. It&#146;s like, it&#146;s like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick
and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother of&#133;See?</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Obsessive Monica has now opened more of the wedding
gifts.]</p>

<p>Joey: (entering) Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?</p>

<p>Monica: No! No! I shouldn&#146;t have even opened these! I mean I&#151;Joey I am
out of control!! Joey, you have to do me a favor. No matter what I say, no matter what I
do, please do not let me open another present! Okay?</p>

<p>Joey: Okay.</p>

<p>Monica: Give me one more.</p>

<p>Joey: Okay. (Hands her one.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: (entering) Hey.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh good, uh you&#146;re here. Uh Pheebs? Listen uh sit down. I-I got
something I want to say. </p>

<p>Phoebe: All right. (She sits down like she&#146;s pregnant again.)</p>

<p>Joey: Umm, now uh&#133; It&#146;s a scary world out there, especially for a
single mom. Y&#146;know, now I always thought you and I had a special bond so&#133; (He
goes to one knee and pulls out a ring.) Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?</p>

<p>Monica: Oh my God! Joey!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hell yeah! I&#146;ll marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)</p>

<p>Monica: You can&#146;t marry him!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey lady, your day&#146;s over! It&#146;s my turn!</p>

<p>Monica: Phoebe!</p>

<p>Joey: Why?! Why can&#146;t she marry me?!</p>

<p>Phoebe: I can and I will! (Kisses him.)</p>

<p>Monica: She&#146;s not pregnant. It&#146;s Rachel. Rachel&#146;s the one
who&#146;s pregnant.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh my God.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey!</p>

<p>Monica: Phoebe I think he would notice if you didn&#146;t have a baby in nine
months!</p>

<p>Phoebe: It&#146;s Joey! (Joey turns and looks at her and she mouths &#145;I love
you&#146; to him.)</p>

<p>Joey: (smiles then stops) Now I can&#146;t believe it! What? Rachel&#146;s
pregnant? (The girls nod yes.) Who&#146;s the father?</p>

<p>Phoebe: We don&#146;t know.</p>

<p>Joey: Ohh&#133; I wonder if that dude.</p>

<p>Monica: There&#146;s a dude?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Who? Who is it?</p>

<p>Joey: About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didn&#146;t see
who it was but&#133; (He walks out and closes the door.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: Was that story over? </p>

<p>(They follow him and meet him in the hall coming out of his apartment carrying a
sweater.)</p>

<p>Joey: The guy left this.</p>

<p>Phoebe: (gasps) Oh my God! I know who the father is&#133; (She walks into Monica
and Chandler&#146;s.)</p>

<p>Monica: People have got to finish their stories!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The Banquet Room, Ross and Chandler are in their tuxes and have started to fake
the pictures.]</p>

<p>Chandler: (to another couple) Uh, excuse me? Could you take a picture of us?</p>

<p>Woman At The Wedding: Oh! Of course. (Ross and Chandler pose and she takes the
picture.)</p>

<p>Man At The Wedding: Uh, would you take one of us?</p>

<p>Chandler: Uhh&#133; Yeah sure. (Holds the camera up to his face.) Click!</p>

<p>Woman At The Wedding: It didn&#146;t click.</p>

<p>Ross: I heard it. I heard it.</p>

<p>Man At The Wedding: But there was no flash.</p>

<p>Woman At The Wedding: Why won&#146;t you take our picture?</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh yeah. I&#146;ll take, I&#146;ll take your picture. (He takes the
picture with his finger over the lens.)</p>

<p>Man At The Wedding: Uh, your finger was covering the lens.</p>

<p>Chandler: Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!</p>

<p>[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are about to go inside.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called
the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!</p>

<p>Rachel: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?</p>

<p>Phoebe: I may play the fool at times, but I&#146;m a little more than a pretty
blond girl with an ass that won&#146;t quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I
believe this belongs to the father of your baby.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh God&#133; Oh, he&#146;s in there right now?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the
Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?</p>

<p>Rachel: Uh, let&#146;s rip!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Really? Are you sure?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh Phoebe!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay, sorry. Yeah. (They go inside to confront the father.)</p>

<p>Tag: Hey Rach.</p>

<p>[Scene: The Banquet Room, Ross is taking a picture of a plant, Chandler a fork. The
band stops.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Why don&#146;t you go up on stage. I&#146;ll get a picture of you
doing the speech.</p>

<p>Ross: Okay. Okay! </p>

<p>(He goes up on stage, mimes like he's giving the speech, and Chandler takes his
picture. However, before he gets down everyone starts clinking their glasses for a real
speech.)</p>

<p>Ross: Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car
is about to be towed.</p>

<p>Anxious Wedding Guest: (rushing up) That&#146;s my car!</p>

<p>Ross: A &#146;95 LeSabre?!</p>

<p>Anxious Wedding Guest: Yes!</p>

<p>Ross: A green LeSabre?</p>

<p>Anxious Wedding Guest: Yes!</p>

<p>Ross: I&#146;m sorry, I meant a blue LeSabre.</p>

<p>Anxious Wedding Guest: Yes! Green-blue!</p>

<p>Ross: Well go! Go move it! (He runs off.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, you ready for the last picture?</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chandler: Get ready to run. (Chandler walks over to the new bride.)
Congratulations on your wedding. (He grabs her, kisses her, Ross takes the picture, and
they both run out.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p>Tag: So, what&#146;s this about?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that
this is your red sweater.</p>

<p>Tag: No. (Unzips his coat.) This is my red sweater.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee or&#133;poison? No? Just for me?
Okay. (Walks away.)</p>

<p>Tag: What&#146;s going on Rach?</p>

<p>Rachel: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But y&#146;know you do wear that
sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?</p>

<p>Tag: Y&#146;know, I&#146;m actually glad Phoebe called. (He pulls out a stool
and Rachel sits down.) I know we broke up because you thought I wasn&#146;t mature enough,
but I&#146;ve really grown up and think we should get back together.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, it&#146;s just not the right time.</p>

<p>Tag: It is the right time. (Takes her hand.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay.</p>

<p>Tag: I&#146;m ready for more.</p>

<p>Rachel: Tag&#133;</p>

<p>Tag: Come on Rach, let&#146;s give it another try.</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m having a baby.</p>

<p>Tag: Oh. (He drops her hand.)</p>

<p>(Pause)</p>

<p>Rachel: You can go.</p>

<p>Tag: Thank you. (Gets up and hurries out.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Obsessive Monica has finished opening all the presents.
She&#146;s ashamed of this, at least, because as someone enters&#133;]</p>

<p>Monica: (throwing up the last present) I don&#146;t know how any of these got
opened?!</p>

<p>Joey: (entering) You opened them all?</p>

<p>Monica: I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going
to trust me with anything ever again!</p>

<p>Joey: Oh hey! You got my parent&#146;s gift! (Holds it up.)</p>

<p>Monica: Yeah. What is that?</p>

<p>Joey: Well, I don&#146;t know. I think it does something to salami.</p>

<p>(Phoebe and Rachel enter.)</p>

<p>Monica: Hey! How&#146;d it go?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah. What-what did Tag say?</p>

<p>Rachel: Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?</p>

<p>Joey: I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. (They hug.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh wow, you didn&#146;t even try to unhook my bra!</p>

<p>Monica: So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?</p>

<p>Rachel: No, I will. I&#146;m just not up for it tonight.</p>

<p>Joey: Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know
you&#146;re not gonna be alone in this.</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m not?</p>

<p>Joey: Listen I uh&#133; (He takes her hand.) It&#146;s a scary world out there
especially if you&#146;re a single mom. Y&#146;know, I always felt like you and I have
this-this special bond. Y&#146;know? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will
you marry me?</p>

<p>Rachel: What?</p>

<p>Monica: What?!</p>

<p>Phoebe: What?!!</p>

<p>Joey: Pheebs, give me the ring back!</p>

<p>Phoebe: No!!</p>

<p>Rachel: No! Joey, oh you&#146;re so sweet. You&#146;re so-so sweet, honey. But
I&#146;m not, I&#146;m not looking for a husband.</p>

<p>Joey: (heartbroken) I understand.</p>

<p>Rachel: Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: I can&#146;t say that didn&#146;t hurt. But I&#146;ll take you back Joey
Tribbiani.</p>

<p>Joey: Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered&#133;</p>

<p>Phoebe: Ooh! A Salami Buddy!</p>

<p>Joey: There you go!</p>

<p>(Chandler and Ross enter with the new pictures.)</p>

<p>Chandler: We&#146;re back!</p>

<p>Monica: Great! We&#146;re hangin&#146; in the kitchen! (She drags him into the
kitchen and turns his back to the living room) Let&#146;s stay in the kitchen!</p>

<p>Chandler: It&#146;s picture time.</p>

<p>Ross: Now you are going to love these.</p>

<p>Chandler: (showing her the pictures) Here&#146;s a picture of Ross. (Shows
another one.) And that&#146;s me. (Another one.) And that&#146;s me and Ross.
(Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.</p>

<p>Monica: Wow! That is a great picture!</p>

<p>Chandler: Eh?</p>

<p>Monica: Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags!
(Throws them into his chest.)</p>

<p>Ross: Huh, didn&#146;t see that coming.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, so this isn&#146;t a picture of our first, but it is a picture
of my first kiss with&#133;with this lady. Which by the look on your face I&#146;m sure
you&#146;ll remember. So we don&#146;t need&#151;(Rips the picture)&#151;There&#146;s no
need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right
now.</p>

<p>Monica: That would be a good idea.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?!
I thought we were supposed to do that together!</p>

<p>Monica: You kissed another woman!</p>

<p>Chandler: Call it even?!</p>

<p>Monica: Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)</p>

<p>Ross: Well, I&#146;m gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with)
in some water.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Wait you stole those from these people&#146;s wedding?</p>

<p>Ross: No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge
me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. (Starts
to leave.) Hey! My sweater! I&#146;ve been looking for this for like a month!</p>

<p>(He exits leaving a stunned Phoebe and Monica.)</p>


<p>Monica and Phoebe: Oh my God!!</p>

<p>Joey: (slow on the uptake) Oh my God!</p>
