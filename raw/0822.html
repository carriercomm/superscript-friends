<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is showing everyone a poster as Ross enters.]</p>

<p>Ross: Hey! What are you guys looking at?</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, it&#146;s a poster for that World War I movie that I&#146;m in, check
it out.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!</p>

<p>Joey: Uh-huh! I know. I&#146;m coming soon to a theater near you! I&#146;m in
THX! I&#146;m unsuitable for children!</p>

<p>Ross: Now I cannot wait to see this.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, yeah, it&#146;s already generating Oscar buzz.</p>

<p>Phoebe: I started that!</p>

<p>Joey: I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and
you&#146;re all invited! (They all gasp.)</p>

<p>Monica: Are we gonna take a limo?</p>

<p>Joey: Sure! Why not?!</p>

<p>Monica: Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!</p>

<p>Rachel: Well obviously I won&#146;t be able to come, for those of you who
haven&#146;t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y&#146;know, I just want
to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you&#146;ve been during this time. I
really couldn&#146;t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine
months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss
being pregnant.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, time lapse, and Rachel is entering still pregnant.]</p>

<p>Rachel: That&#146;s right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on the
couch) Come on people! Please make some room!</p>

<p>Ross: Uh sweetie, maybe you&#146;d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the
green armchair.)</p>

<p>Rachel: You. Like you haven&#146;t done enough.</p>

<p>Ross: Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.
I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it&#146;s the
male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I&#146;d be far away in the sea. (He sits
back down.)</p>

<p>(Rachel turns and looks at the group on the couch and they move over. Chandler measures
the room they&#146;ve made with his arm and decides it&#146;s not enough and they all move
over again.)</p>

<p>Rachel: God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh I know, I&#146;ve been there. I remember toward the end&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: (interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, that&#146;s a great story. Can you tell it
to me when you&#146;re getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To
the baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!</p>

<p>Chandler: Let&#146;s. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are there as Rachel
enters.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Hey! Did you have the baby yet?</p>

<p>Rachel: Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? &#145;Cause I&#146;ll
do it.</p>

<p>Monica: What are you doing here so early?</p>

<p>Rachel: They sent me home from work. They were like, &quot;Start your maternity
leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby.&quot; Well y&#146;know what? Screw &#145;em!
If they don&#146;t want me there, I&#146;ll just hang out with you guys.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Or you can do volunteer work.</p>

<p>(Joey&#146;s cell phone rings and he answers it.)</p>

<p>Joey: Hello?</p>

<p>Estelle: Joey! It&#146;s Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one
guest tickets to your premiere.</p>

<p>Joey: One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!</p>

<p>Estelle: Well, I sold four of them on <i>Ebay</i>. You&#146;ll be sitting next
to HotGuy372.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh my God. So that&#146;s it?! I only get to bring one guest?</p>

<p>Estelle: Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? (Joey hangs up on her.) Hello?</p>

<p>Joey: (to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra
ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.</p>

<p>Rachel: (overhearing that) What-what about me?</p>

<p>Joey: You said you didn&#146;t want to go.</p>

<p>Rachel: I don&#146;t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just
because I&#146;m pregnant you think I&#146;m invisible.</p>

<p>Joey: Definitely not invisible.</p>

<p>Monica: Well, well Ross didn&#146;t care enough to be here, so I think he&#146;s
out. You snooze you lose.</p>

<p>Chandler: He&#146;s not snoozing, he&#146;s teaching a class.</p>

<p>Monica: Well then somebody&#146;s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect
you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut
down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)</p>

<p>Chandler: I haven&#146;t seen this dress.</p>

<p>Monica: Star in a movie.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart.
What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.</p>

<p>Joey: Well uh&#133;I think I want to take Chandler.</p>

<p>Phoebe: (still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster)
Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe&#151;Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going
off.)</p>

<p>Chandler: You really want to take me?</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah! Yeah! I mean I&#146;m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but
y&#146;know Chandler always supported my career. He&#146;s paid for acting classes and
head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.</p>

<p>Chandler: So you&#146;re never actually going to pay me back?</p>

<p>Monica: Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you&#146;re
gonna take him? Joey, I don&#146;t think you&#146;re comprehending just how slutty this
dress is!</p>

<p>Joey: It&#146;s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it&#146;s-it&#146;s
everything. Y&#146;know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was
really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn&#146;t get parts that I really
wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn&#146;t believe in myself.</p>

<p>Chandler: I always knew you were gonna make it. I&#146;m so proud of you.</p>

<p>Joey: Thanks. That means a lot to me.</p>

<p>(They look at each other and smile for a while.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.</p>

<p>Joey: (in a manly voice) I&#146;m gonna go shave. (Gets up.)</p>

<p>Chandler: (in a manly voice) Yeah well, I&#146;m gonna go spit. (He goes into
the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, I have to pee. If I don&#146;t come out in five minutes it&#146;s
because I&#146;ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: When she comes out, you hold her nose, I&#146;ll blow in her mouth, and
the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.</p>

<p>Monica: She&#146;s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?</p>

<p>Phoebe: I don&#146;t know. I-I think it&#146;s still gonna be a while.</p>

<p>Monica: Hmm, care to make it interesting? I&#146;ll bet you that she&#146;ll
have it by this time tomorrow.</p>

<p>Phoebe: You&#146;re on!</p>

<p>Monica: Okay, how much?</p>

<p>Phoebe: One hundred thousand dollars!</p>

<p>Monica: How about fifty bucks?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Fine! I&#146;ll call Zurich and move some money around.</p>

<p>Rachel: (calling from the bathroom) All right, who&#146;s turn is it to help me
get up!</p>

<p>(They both look at each other, then Phoebe gets an idea.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: No one&#146;s here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!</p>

<p>[Scene: The World Premiere of Over There, Joey and Chandler are arriving in a limo and
are about to walk down the red carpet.]</p>

<p>Chandler: This is so exciting! It&#146;s so glamorous! People taking our
picture. How do I look?</p>

<p>Joey: A little tall.</p>

<p>Chandler: What?</p>

<p>Joey: Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler
does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)</p>

<p>Chandler: It&#146;s just so glamorous.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Rachel is entering, still pregnant.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you&#146;re still pregnant. Oh, I&#146;m
sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y&#146;know what? You look great. Yeah, like
fifty bucks.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a
squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)</p>

<p>Monica: Damnit! Damnit!! Here&#146;s your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: It&#146;s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?</p>

<p>Monica: Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Fine! You&#146;re on!</p>

<p>Monica: Okay.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Until then, General Grant, why don&#146;t you set up camp (She puts the
bill in her bra) right there.</p>

<p>Ross: (entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor&#146;s appointment.</p>

<p>Monica: She&#146;s in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Ross: Rach, we gotta go.</p>

<p>Rachel: In a minute!!!</p>

<p>Ross: People ask me why we&#146;re not together, I just don&#146;t know what to
tell them.</p>

<p>Rachel: (entering) All right, all right. Let&#146;s go!</p>

<p>Ross: Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor&#146;s keeping the office
open late for us, but if you hurry&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: No, I&#146;m fine.</p>

<p>Ross: Really? You don&#146;t think that&#146;s a little inappropriate.
(She&#146;s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: Good God man don&#146;t anger it.</p>

<p>Rachel: Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am
somewhat comfortable.</p>

<p>Ross: Fine! Fine! Y&#146;know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You&#146;re the
mommy.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh uh-uh pal! Don&#146;t call me mommy! It&#146;s bad enough you call
your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)</p>

<p>Monica: I&#146;m actually with her on this one.</p>

<p>[Scene: Inside Joey&#146;s Premiere, he is intently watching the movie.]</p>

<p>Joey: (onscreen) &quot;I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all
along.&quot; </p>

<p>Joey: (To Chandler) Okay, this is it. It&#146;s my big fight scene coming up.
(He looks over and Chandler and notices that he&#146;s asleep.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Dr. Long&#146;s Office, Ross and Rachel are waiting for the doctor. Ross is
drumming his fingers on the bed.]</p>

<p>Rachel: Ross.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah?</p>

<p>Rachel: Can I ask you something?</p>

<p>Ross: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Rachel: When Carol was pregnant with Ben&#133;</p>

<p>Ross: Mmm?</p>

<p>Rachel: &#133;were you this irritating?</p>

<p>Ross: Wow!</p>

<p>Rachel: Excuse me?!</p>

<p>Ross: Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you&#146;ve been a little short with me
lately. I&#146;m not trying to irritate you.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.</p>

<p>Ross: Y&#146;know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don&#146;t we not speak
until then.</p>

<p>Rachel: (silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That&#146;s
great!</p>

<p>Ross: Y&#146;know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to
deliver a baby that&#146;s half human and half pure evil!</p>

<p>(Dr. Long enters.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi Dr. Long, how are you?</p>

<p>Ross: (to Rachel) Oh, you&#146;re nice to her.</p>

<p>Rachel: She has the drugs!</p>

<p>Dr. Long: We&#146;ll do a quick check.</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay. (Rachel lies back.)</p>

<p>Dr. Long: So, eight days late huh?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah.</p>

<p>Dr. Long: You must be a little uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Rachel: Eh, just a tad.</p>

<p>Dr. Long: You&#146;re about 80 percent effaced, so you&#146;re on your way. It
still could last a little while longer. If you&#146;re anxious there are a few ways to
help things along.</p>

<p>Ross: Do them!!</p>

<p>Dr. Long: Actually, they&#146;re things you can do. Just some home remedies, but
in my experience I&#146;ve found that some of them are quite effective.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, we are ready to try anything.</p>

<p>Dr. Long: Okay, there&#146;s an herbal tea you can drink.</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay.</p>

<p>Dr. Long: You can take some caster oil, there&#146;s eating spicy foods&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: Great! We will do all of those.</p>

<p>Dr. Long: &#133;taking a long walk, and then there&#146;s the one that&#146;s
proved most effective: sex.</p>

<p>(Rachel turns and looks at Ross.)</p>

<p>Ross: You&#146;ve got to be kidding me!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Joey&#146;s Premiere, the movie is ending and it takes the applause to wake up
Chandler.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!</p>

<p>Joey: You liked it? You really liked it?</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh-ho-ho, yeah!</p>

<p>Joey: Which part exactly?</p>

<p>Chandler: The whole thing! Can we go?</p>

<p>Joey: Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.</p>

<p>Chandler: I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?</p>

<p>Chandler: I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.</p>

<p>Joey: You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn&#146;t take any of my
suggestions! That&#146;s for coming buddy. I&#146;ll see you later. (Starts to walk out.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Don&#146;t go! I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m so sorry! (Sees another guy
who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!
(Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Rachel are there as Phoebe and Monica enter.]</p>

<p>Monica: Hey!</p>

<p>Ross: Hey.</p>

<p>Rachel: Hi!</p>

<p>Monica: What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?</p>

<p>Rachel: No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea,
caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, there is one thing that we haven&#146;t tried, but someone thinks
that, (mimicking Ross) &quot;That will open up a can of worms.&quot;</p>

<p>Monica: Well what is it? What is it? If it&#146;s gonna help bring the baby
here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.</p>

<p>Ross: It&#146;s sex.</p>

<p>Monica: Do it!</p>

<p>Ross: Monica!</p>

<p>Monica: I&#146;m just saying it&#146;s been a really long time for you. I mean,
women have needs. Do it, get yours!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh I-I don&#146;t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you
had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic. </p>

<p>Monica: All right, let&#146;s be practical, if Ross isn&#146;t willing to do it,
he&#146;s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow
Chandler&#151;Chandler is good!</p>

<p>Ross: Monica, what is the matter with you?</p>

<p>Monica: Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.</p>

<p>Rachel: Why? Why today?</p>

<p>Monica: Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you&#146;re gonna have the baby
and I don&#146;t want to lose again!</p>

<p>Ross: What?! While she&#146;s been going through this hell, you&#146;ve been
making money?! You&#146;re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers
her head and shakes it yes.)</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;ll take that bet.</p>

<p>Ross: What?!</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, I&#146;m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!</p>

<p>Ross: Can I get some of that action?</p>

<p>Monica: Wait a minute! Now I&#146;m betting against all three of you?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh honey, don&#146;t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow&#146;s the
day.</p>

<p>Monica: Oh, okay!</p>

<p>(Rachel turns her head to Ross and Phoebe and mouths, &quot;No way.&quot;)</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is there as Joey enters.]</p>

<p>Joey: Hey! Sleeping beauty!</p>

<p>Chandler: Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I
still feel so bad!</p>

<p>Joey: (in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?</p>

<p>Chandler: I&#146;m so sorry.</p>

<p>Joey: Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between
us! Okay? You&#146;ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took
you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?</p>

<p>Chandler: What?!</p>

<p>Joey: Give me a number, I don&#146;t want to owe you anything!</p>

<p>Chandler: You don&#146;t owe me anything, I don&#146;t want you money&#133;</p>

<p>Joey: Ah-ah-ah! We&#146;re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head
shots. Right, how much were those?</p>

<p>Chandler: I don&#146;t know, five hundred dollars?</p>

<p>Joey: Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?</p>

<p>Chandler: Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.</p>

<p>Joey: Okay, so that&#146;s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred,
that&#146;s&#133; (Pauses to figure it out.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Do you want a calculator?</p>

<p>Joey: Please! </p>

<p>Chandler: Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was
right.)</p>

<p>Joey: All right, what else?</p>

<p>Chandler: Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap
classes&#133;</p>

<p>Joey: Which we&#146;re still keeping under our hats!</p>

<p>Chandler: Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play
where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out
Jamaican. </p>

<p>Joey: What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) &quot;The
south will rise again man.&quot;</p>

<p>Chandler: Yes, money well spent!</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food&#133;</p>

<p>Joey: Okay. Okay, so I&#146;m writing you a check for&#133;So you fell asleep
during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are trying the home remedies again.]</p>

<p>Ross: Come on, finish your enchilada.</p>

<p>Rachel: Ross I&#151;We tried all the spicy food. It&#146;s not working.</p>

<p>Ross: Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha&#133; Oh God! So&#133;so hot!
(Rubs his eyes.) Oh my&#151;(Laughs.) By the way, you don&#146;t want to touch the pepper
and then touch your eye.</p>

<p>Rachel: I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes
me want to have sex with you.</p>

<p>Ross: Stop it.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We
know what&#146;s gonna work! It&#146;s doctor recommended!</p>

<p>Ross: I&#146;m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I&#146;m
dying.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh come on Ross, we&#146;ve done it before we&#146;ll do it again,
it&#146;ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.</p>

<p>Ross: This is insane, I&#146;m not gonna make love to you just so that
you&#146;ll go into labor.</p>

<p>Rachel: Make love? What are you a girl?</p>

<p>Ross: Always a great way to get in a man&#146;s pants.</p>

<p>Rachel: But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of
me as a ketchup bottle, y&#146;know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just
to get something to come out.</p>

<p>Ross: I love when you talk dirty to me.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, I know it. You&#146;re right. That&#146;s not sexy. Oh&#133;Oh!
(Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed
over and get it. (Tries too, but can&#146;t quite seem to make it.) Oh God!</p>

<p>Ross: Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.</p>

<p>Rachel: Come on Ross! I&#146;m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now
you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.</p>

<p>Ross: Y&#146;know what?</p>

<p>Rachel: What?!</p>

<p>Ross: Forget it.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh wow! What now Ross you&#146;re not gonna talk? How on earth will you
ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you&#146;d think
the damn jalepeno would&#146;ve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That&#146;s not
enough&#133; (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!</p>

<p>Ross: I&#146;m getting that baby out of you!</p>

<p>(They kiss again.)</p>

<p>Rachel: (breaking the kiss) Oh God!</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, I know.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.</p>

<p>Ross: I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the
keys?</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!</p>

<p>Ross: Hey!</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah.</p>

<p>Ross: We&#146;re having a baby.</p>

<p>(They hug and then kiss one more time.)</p>

<p>Rachel: I didn&#146;t uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but
do you think we have time to&#133;</p>

<p>Ross: Not so much.</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay.</p>
