<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's Bathroom, Chandler and Monica are sharing a candlelight
bubble bath while drinking champagne and they clink their glasses.]</p>

<p>Monica: You look cute in bubbles.</p>

<p>Chandler: Ehh, you're just liquored up.</p>

<p>(They move into kiss but are interrupted by Joey knocking on the door.)</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!</p>

<p>(Monica quickly dives under the water as Joey enters. He looks a little shocked at what
Chandler's doing.)</p>

<p>Chandler: I've had a very long, hard day.</p>

<p>Joey: Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?</p>

<p>Chandler: Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.</p>

<p>Joey: Okay.</p>

<p>(Joey turns to leave but stops at the door.)</p>

<p>Joey: You sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?</p>

<p>Chandler: For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!</p>

<p>Joey: All right!</p>

<p>(Joey leaves and Monica comes up for air.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about
chicken.</p>

<p>Monica: Chicken? I could eat some chicken.</p>

<p>Chandler: Hey Joe!</p>

<p>(Monica goes back underwater as Joey re-enters.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a
Coke-(Yelps in </p>

<p>pain as Monica grabs him underwater)-Diet Coke.</p>

<p>(Joey gives him a thumbs up and heads for the chicken.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are eating breakfast.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: (entering) Hey!</p>

<p>Chandler: Hey, Pheebs!</p>

<p>Joey: Mornin' Pheebs!</p>

<p>Phoebe: I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this
driver&#133;</p>

<p>Joey: (interrupting) Was his name Angus? (Monica and Chandler laugh.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: What?</p>

<p>Joey: Oh, he was this cab driver we had in London.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh. Ha-ha-ha. All right, anyway&#133;</p>

<p>Monica: Wait, what that place, that pub he took us too?</p>

<p>Chandler: Uh, The Wheatsheaf.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh&#133;</p>

<p>Monica: Bodington's!</p>

<p>All: Bodington's! Woohoo! (And they all high-five each other.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah, so, he had a really funny hat&#151;I don't want to talk about it.</p>

<p>Ross: (entering) Hey!</p>

<p>All: Hey!</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, Ross, Bodington's!</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah! (They high-five.)</p>

<p>Joey: That was good beer.</p>

<p>Ross: Ohh&#133;</p>

<p>Joey: Y'know, I'd walk back to London for another frosty one of those bad
boys.</p>

<p>Ross: Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.</p>

<p>Joey: Later! (Exits.)</p>

<p>Ross: Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?</p>

<p>Monica: Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, (Checks watch)
she should be here by now.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?</p>

<p>Monica: No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.</p>

<p>Ross: Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the
airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife!
Rachel is my wife! Y'know&#151;Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?</p>

<p>Phoebe: So you still hadn't heard from Emily?</p>

<p>Ross: No, not since I lost her at the airport.</p>

<p>Chandler: I can't believe she can out run you man!</p>

<p>Ross: HEY, SHE'S FAST!! OKAY?!! (Chandler is so shocked at Ross's
outburst that he drops his spoon and backs up) Oh! You-you think you can be beat
me? Let's go! Outside!!</p>

<p>Rachel: (entering) Hi!</p>

<p>All: Hey! (They all go hug her, except for Ross.)</p>

<p>Ross: Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.</p>

<p>Ross: That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.</p>

<p>Rachel: Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met
the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel. (Goes and puts her luggage away.)</p>

<p>Ross: So, what? That's it?</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best. (They hug.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh no, you're the best.</p>

<p>Ross: (breaking the hug) Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! (Runs to the
door.) Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem,
red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That
oughta get her talking to me again.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.</p>

<p>(Ross bangs his fists together to tell Chandler off, like what was learned last season.
Read about it <a href="http://thecfsi.com/season4/405jng.htm#rossthng">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Monica: Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!</p>

<p>Rachel: What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I
couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up
to me all the time going, &quot;Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?&quot; I mean, it was
sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why,
because I make very bad decisions.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh that's not true.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.</p>

<p>Phoebe: London is stupid! Stupid!</p>

<p>Rachel: Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now
on you make all of my decisions for me.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh&#133; No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having
that kind of power and control over someone's life.</p>

<p>Monica: I'll do it!</p>

<p>Rachel: That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, I gotta go to work.</p>

<p>(He gets up and gives Monica a rather passionate kiss as Rachel and Phoebe look on in
amazement. After the kiss ends, Chandler suddenly realizes what he just did, so he decides
to do something rather rash.)</p>

<p>Chandler: And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back. </p>

<p>(He goes over and gives Rachel the same treatment he gave Monica, only Rachel is
shocked.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Pheebs! (He goes over and kisses Phoebe, who is also stunned.) Always
a pleasure. (And he struts out leaving the girls to stare at each other.)</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, Chandler and Joey are there looking at pictures
from the trip to London.]</p>

<p>Monica: Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you
at the reception.</p>

<p>Rachel: Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't&#151;I still can't believe
it. (Rachel grabs the picture from Monica)</p>

<p>Monica: Honey, sweetie, by the edges.</p>

<p>Rachel: I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it (She grabs the rest of
the pictures)&#133;</p>

<p>Monica: Ohh. (Monica covers her eyes in horror.)</p>

<p>Rachel: &#133;I mean it's my fault.</p>

<p>Monica: Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh my God! (She licks the top picture and hands them back.)</p>

<p>Monica: Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I
know that wasn't about me.</p>

<p>Joey: (To Chandler) I bet it was about her a little.</p>

<p>Monica: If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice
that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! (Gunther turns to
listen in.) I mean, he's nice, he's cute.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda&#133;</p>

<p>Monica: (Interrupting) Oh, what about that guy over there? (She points at
another guy and Gunther is deflated.) Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at
the counter that time.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, I don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p>Monica: You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your
decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.</p>

<p>Rachel: All right, you're the boss. I guess I gotta do what you tell me.</p>

<p>Joey: Say that to him and you're golden. (She just glares at him.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: (entering) Hey!</p>

<p>Rachel: Hey!</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, Pheebs!</p>

<p>Monica: We got out pictures back from London. (Shows her one.) Here's all of us
at the Tower of London.</p>

<p>Phoebe: (Grabs the pictures) Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and
Joey and you and me. (She picks up a magic marker and draws herself in. Monica can't
watch.)</p>

<p>Chandler: All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much
haven't we?</p>

<p>Phoebe: No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever
get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.</p>

<p>All: Sorry.</p>

<p>(Rachel returns.)</p>

<p>Monica: What happened?</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date
tomorrow night.</p>

<p>Monica: See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!</p>

<p>Rachel: Well&#133;</p>

<p>(Gunther goes up to the guy and holds a sign that reads, &quot;We reserve the right to
refuse service to anyone.&quot;)</p>

<p>Gunther: (To the guy) Get out!</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler enters to find Monica waiting patiently for him.
He closes the door and they start kissing.]</p>

<p>Monica: What took you so long?</p>

<p>Chandler: I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.</p>

<p>Monica: Oh, good. </p>

<p>(They start kissing and turn around so that Chandler is facing the door. And Chandler
sees Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey walk in and quickly ends the kiss with Monica.)</p>

<p>Chandler: So, thanks for having me over! Rach. (Goes over, grabs her, and kisses
her.) Pheebs. (After a moment while he decides how to kiss her around her belly, grabs her
and kisses her.)</p>

<p>Joey: (Jumping out of his way) See ya!! (To the girls.) What the hell was that?!</p>

<p>Monica: Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.</p>

<p>Rachel: That's not European!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Well, it felt French.</p>

<p>(Joey is intrigued.)</p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway between the apartments, Rachel is returning from her date with
Dave.]</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh God, I really had a good time!</p>

<p>Dave: Yeah, me too. (They reach her door.) So, I guess this is it.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?</p>

<p>Dave: Yeah!</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this.
Umm, okay, just hold on a second.</p>

<p>Dave: Okay, yeah!</p>

<p>(She enters the apartment, leaving Dave in the hallway, to find Ross sitting on the
couch with a big box.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Umm, hi!</p>

<p>Ross: Hi.</p>

<p>Rachel: Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.</p>

<p>Ross: She's doing her laundry.</p>

<p>Rachel: What's that? (Points to the box.)</p>

<p>Ross: It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for
each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, honey that's awful.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go
wander out in the rain for a while.</p>

<p>Rachel: But, it's not raining.</p>

<p>Ross: I can't catch a break!</p>

<p>Rachel: Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right
here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All
right? (She goes out to talk to Dave) Hey, Dave!</p>

<p>Dave: Yeah?</p>

<p>Rachel: Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just
really sick. Okay? Bye! (She goes back in to talk to Ross.) Honey, listen, I know, I know
things seem so bad right now.</p>

<p>Monica: (Poking her head in) Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped
some socks.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah. (She goes out to join her in the hall and starts looking for the
dropped socks.)</p>

<p>Monica: What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you
want to fall into the trap?!</p>

<p>Rachel: Ohh! You did not drop any socks!</p>

<p>Monica: I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you
listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What
the hell were you trying to do?</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted&#133;tell him y'know,
that I'm still in love with him.</p>

<p>Monica: (Gasps) What?!! You cannot tell him that!!</p>

<p>Rachel: Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!</p>

<p>Monica: I make the decisions, and I say no.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what,
you're fired.</p>

<p>Monica: You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say,
&quot;I'm not fired!&quot; Ha!</p>

<p>Rachel: Well&#133; (At a loss for words, she grabs some of Monica's laundry and
throws it on the floor as a diversion to allow Rachel to run back inside and close the
door. Monica chases her to find that Rachel had locked the door.)</p>

<p>Monica: Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!</p>

<p>Joey: (Poking his head out.) Havin' some trouble?</p>

<p>Monica: Rachel locked the door.</p>

<p>Joey: I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway, continued from earlier. Monica is still locked out.]</p>

<p>Monica: Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!</p>

<p>[Cut to inside the apartment, Ross decides to let Monica in and goes over and opens the
door in mid-pound.]</p>

<p>Monica: Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?</p>

<p>Rachel: No.</p>

<p>Monica: I really need to talk to you.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, then talk!</p>

<p>Monica: Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted
to do?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yes!</p>

<p>Ross: What thing?</p>

<p>Monica: Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a
really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows
who she might (Turns to look at Ross) end up hurting.</p>

<p>Ross: Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I
gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. (Looks at the rose mulch.) My
God, think of the massacre.</p>

<p>Rachel: I'm gonna do it.</p>

<p>Monica: All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you
tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea.
Because I bet you, you can't.</p>

<p>Rachel: But I&#133;</p>

<p>Monica: Please!</p>

<p>Rachel: All right, fine.</p>

<p>(There's a loud bang on the door.)</p>

<p>Monica: Joey, I'm in!</p>

<p>Joey: (In tremendous pain) All right. Good deal.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, Monica, and Rachel are there as Phoebe enters.]</p>

<p>All: Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!</p>

<p>Joey: Uh, okay, Pheebs?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah?</p>

<p>Joey: Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to
go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah?</p>

<p>Joey: All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all
take a little trip together!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!</p>

<p>Monica: Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic (Phoebe gasps), in Central
Park!</p>

<p>Phoebe: (excited) Central&#133;(not so excited) Park!</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, all of us! All day!</p>

<p>Phoebe: That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we
gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? &quot;Well, it's right by my house, all
right!&quot; </p>

<p>Chandler: Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park
idea. (Gets up to leave.)</p>

<p>Rachel: (stopping him) Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr.
Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European
thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable
and I just&#151;y'know&#151;stop it!</p>

<p>Chandler: I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.</p>

<p>Phoebe: That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.</p>

<p>Monica: Makes me wanna puke! (Chandler looks at her, quizzically.) </p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, and Joey are there as Ross enters with
Phoebe.]</p>

<p>Ross: Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!</p>

<p>Joey: Phoebe!</p>

<p>Chandler: Hey, Pheebs!</p>

<p>Rachel: Phoebe, woo!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay, woo! Hi.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little&#133; Y'know, it
didn't have any&#133; It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we
would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?</p>

<p>Joey: Mine!</p>

<p>Ross: Wait! It was my plan.</p>

<p>Joey: Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.</p>

<p>Ross: And, I came up with Atlantic City.</p>

<p>Joey: Which, is the new plan!</p>

<p>Monica: Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!</p>

<p>(They all go pack except for Ross.)</p>

<p>Monica: Come on Rach, let's go.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.</p>

<p>Monica: No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Monica: Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone
that you love them and not have them say it back?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, I-I don't care.</p>

<p>Monica: Okay. I-I can't watch. (Leaves as sits down to read the paper.)</p>

<p>Rachel: What 'cha readin'?</p>

<p>Ross: The paper.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, what's it about?</p>

<p>Ross: Events from around the globe.</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to
talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're
wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.</p>

<p>Ross: Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah. </p>

<p>Rachel: Okay.</p>

<p>Ross: Go ahead.</p>

<p>Rachel: Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say
it. Uhh, (pause) I'm still in love with you Ross.</p>

<p>(Ross is stunned.)</p>

<p>Ross: Wow. Umm&#133; Huh&#133; I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.</p>

<p>(Rachel starts laughing hysterically.) </p>

<p>Ross: What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.</p>

<p>Rachel: (Laughing) I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.</p>

<p>Ross: Why are you laughing?</p>

<p>Rachel: Because (laughs), because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's
ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and
it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know?
And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel (laughs) was like,
&quot;You are such an idiot!&quot;</p>

<p>Ross: Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife
since the wedding.</p>

<p>Rachel: (laughs) I'm sorry, that's not funny.</p>

<p>Ross: Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where
my wife is. (Laughs) &quot;Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?&quot; Don't know! </p>

<p>Rachel: Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you
just forget that I told you this?</p>

<p>Ross: Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.</p>

<p>Ross: That is what the thing is.</p>

<p>Rachel: Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that
just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?</p>

<p>Ross: No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always
great when someone tells you they love you.</p>

<p>Rachel: That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice. (They hug.)</p>

<p>Ross: No thank you for&#133; Thank you.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is about ready to leave for Atlantic City.]</p>

<p>Ross: Okay, let's go!</p>

<p>Chandler: Atlantic City!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for
rolling bones! </p>

<p>(They high-five and howl, but Phoebe suddenly stops and the guys gasp and retreat in
shock.)</p>

<p>Joey: Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?</p>

<p>Monica: Oh my God! You're water broke!</p>

<p>The Guys: Ohh!</p>

<p>Phoebe: All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun! (She starts out the door.)</p>

<p>All: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!</p>

<p>Chandler: Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!</p>

<p>Ross: Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.</p>

<p>Rachel: High-five, the babies are coming! (They all high-five.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: Wait, wait, remember when my water broke? (They all high-five again.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Ending Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway between the apartments, they are taking Phoebe to the hospital but
Chandler and Monica hold back.]</p>

<p>Monica: I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!</p>

<p>Chandler: I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.</p>

<p>(They both kiss.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel
every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.</p>

<p>Monica: Do you know anything about women?</p>

<p>Chandler: No.</p>

<p>Monica: That's all right. </p>

<p>Chandler: Okay. (They kiss again.)</p>
