<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And
bigger boobs! </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what
about you? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd..
make myself omnipotent forever. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were
omnipotent? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: I cannot sleep in a public place. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Would you look at her? She is so peaceful. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: (waking and startling them) Oh! What what
what! ...Hi. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: I got no sleep last night! </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: Why? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and
they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to
reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel
and me tonight. </font></p>

I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. </font></p>

check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking
you. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: We love you, man. (Kisses Ross) </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: So? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and
couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: Well, aren't we Mr. &quot;The glass is
half empty.&quot; </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October

consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her
lesbian lover. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: (stops) I have no idea. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: C'mon, Ross! </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off
it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: You got it.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: I remember the day I got my first pay check.
There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Wow, you worked in a mine? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: I worked in a <em>Dairy Queen</em>, why? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I
wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally&#151;(opens
envelope)&#151;not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what-
Chandler, look at that. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: (looking) Oh, this is not that bad. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've
got this job- </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Leslie:</strong> Well. Your mom didn't tell us
about the blobbies.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Weeeell, it's rum, and- </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to
drink.) </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: We thought since Phoebe was staying over
tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got
cookie dough, we got <em>Twister</em>... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.) </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: Ooh! Ooh! And I brought <em>Operation</em>!
But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy! </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: (on phone) Could you please tell me what
this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been
some unusual activity on your account. </font></p>

activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they
wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money,
everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and
I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then
you can tell them I'm okay, okay? </font></p>

left the building, can you call back? </font></p>

we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost... </font></p>

everything. And for what? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Ah, the other Jack. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but
then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant
outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you
live in the Village.. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a
cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him- </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was
clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: So what, you're not the only one. I mean,
half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's
all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: Oh, like that's a word. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it
doesn't come together? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: ...Pheebs? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't
like this question. </font></p>

get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans? </font></p>

then- when you do- he's a preppy animal. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">[Scene: The Emergency Room, Ross is still going on about
his first night with Carol.]</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: I remember the moonlight coming through the
window- and her face had the most incredible glow. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical
feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: He's right, enough, already. What is the big
deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her
for seven years after that. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: Look, it's just a little more complicated... </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: Well, what? What? What is it? That she
left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on
the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you... </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: Then what? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles
the last part) </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: What? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: It was my <strong>first time</strong>. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: So in your whole life, you've only been
with one&#151;(He gets a look too)&#151;oh. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Joey: Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There
was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the girls are still out on the

vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: Uh-huh. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha
haaaah! </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't
feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: What?! You slept with Jason? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: You'd already broken up. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: How long? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Phoebe: A couple hours. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Oh, that's nice! </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up
and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine
Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: Hello? Like he was really gonna send you
one? (To Phoebe) She was a <strong>big girl</strong>. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Monica: Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade! </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Rachel: I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica
and Rachel start to squabble) </font></p>

one woman? </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Chandler: I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet,
it's romantic... </font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="3">Ross: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? </font></p>
