<p>[Scene: Rachel&#146;s bedroom; Rachel is awoken by a man singing in the next
apartment.]</p>

<p>The Singing Man: (singing, duh) Morning&#146;s here! Sunshine is here! The sky
is clear, the morning&#146;s here! The morning&#146;s here!</p>

<p>Rachel: HEY!! Do you have to do that? It&#146;s Saturday!</p>

<p>The Singing Man: Oh come on! Morning&#146;s here! (Starts singing)
Morning&#146;s here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!</p>

<p>(Rachel slams shut her window and storms into the living room, where Joey and Monica
are eating breakfast.)</p>

<p>Rachel: I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate
the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!</p>

<p>Joey: Are you kidding? I love that guy! (Starts singing) Morning&#146;s here!
Morning is here&#151;</p>

<p>Rachel: Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.</p>

<p>Monica: Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.</p>

<p>Rachel: Monica, you don&#146;t even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the
floor!</p>

<p>Monica: Y&#146;know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay,
I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;m so sorry.</p>

<p>Monica: Okay.</p>

<p>Joey: See, this is a great apartment.</p>

<p>Monica: Shut up! This place is a hole!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s bedroom; Ross and Emily are making out. Ross as a new feature.]</p>

<p>Emily: Oh, blimey, I still can&#146;t believe you&#146;ve got an earring!</p>

<p>(Yep, it&#146;s a little gold loop.)</p>

<p>Ross: Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe? (Shakes his head around,
pretending like he&#146;s jamming.)</p>

<p>Emily: He does that?!</p>

<p>Ross: Uh, I don&#146;t know, whatever.</p>

<p>Emily: I think it makes you look really dangerous.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh, I know. Y&#146;know what, I never would&#146;ve gotten this if it
weren&#146;t for you. No really, when I&#146;m with you I&#146;m-I&#146;m like this whole
other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love
that guy!</p>

<p>Emily: I love both of you!</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah?</p>

<p>(They kiss.)</p>

<p>Emily: I wish I didn&#146;t have to go.</p>

<p>Ross: Then don&#146;t. Stay here. Just don&#146;t go so soon to London, just one
more day.</p>

<p>Emily: Ohh, Ross, please!</p>

<p>Ross: One more day, seriously/</p>

<p>Emily: Don&#146;t do this to me, again. You&#146;d know I&#146;d stay here in a
minute, but I&#146;d really miss so much work, they&#146;ll fire me.</p>

<p>Ross: So, then you can stay as long as you want.</p>

<p>Emily: I wish I could.</p>

<p>Ross: Oh no. Don&#146;t, don&#146;t, don&#146;t start packing. Come on! (She
puts some clothes into her bag, and Ross throws them out.)</p>

<p>Emily: I don&#146;t think you understand packing. Look, I just don&#146;t want
to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.</p>

<p>Emily: You didn&#146;t!</p>

<p>Ross: No. No, I didn&#146;t. I didn&#146;t want to be that guy.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are watching
one of those Kung Fu movies and imitating the moves.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: (entering, wearing Santa pants) Hello!</p>

<p>Chandler: Ho! Ho! Ho!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Excuse me.</p>

<p>Chandler: Your pants!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh, yeah! You like &#145;em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and
got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!</p>

<p>Joey: Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.</p>

<p>Phoebe: What?</p>

<p>Chandler: Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesn&#146;t get it.) Santa Claus&#146;s
pants.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Nuh-uh! They&#146;re maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby
names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists who&#146;s been naughty and who&#146;s been
nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.)
Ohh.</p>

<p>Rachel: (entering) Hey!</p>

<p>Monica: (entering) Hey!</p>

<p>Rachel: So&#151;Hey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?</p>

<p>Phoebe: I don&#146;t know! How are the-the-the-the, y&#146;know&#151;You&#146;re
clothes aren&#146;t funny.</p>

<p>Monica: Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?</p>

<p>Chandler: Uhh, a T-shirt that says, &quot;I don&#146;t belong here.&quot;</p>

<p>Joey: You have Knicks tickets?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, my mom got my dad&#146;s season tickets in the divorce, so she
just gave them to me.</p>

<p>Monica: Yeah, apparently, they&#146;re pretty good seats.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah.</p>

<p>Joey: (examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!</p>

<p>Rachel: Do you guys want these?</p>


<p>Joey: Yeah!</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah we do!</p>

<p>Rachel: Ohh, well you got &#145;em.</p>


<p>Both: All right!</p>

<p>Rachel: Just give us our apartment back!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Boy! I didn&#146;t see that coming!</p>

<p>Chandler: Are you serious?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.</p>

<p>Monica: Yeah, what, do you think we&#146;re stupid?</p>

<p>Joey: You&#146;re not stupid. You&#146;re meaner than I thought.</p>

<p>Monica: What do you say?</p>

<p>Chandler: Forget it! Okay, I&#146;m not giving up my bachelor pad for some
basketball seats!</p>

<p>Rachel: You&#146;re bachelor pad?!</p>

<p>Monica: Have you even had a girl up here?</p>

<p>Chandler: No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, you do!</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is whining to Chandler about the tickets.]</p>

<p>Joey: Come on!</p>

<p>Chandler: (ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?</p>

<p>Gunther: Good one.</p>

<p>Joey: Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?</p>

<p>Chandler: Forget it! Okay, I&#146;m not giving up the apartment.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh come&#151;look, when I was a kid my dad&#146;s company gave season
tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of
course, he wasn&#146;t in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!</p>

<p>Ross: (entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)</p>

<p>Joey: Hey!</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh my God!</p>

<p>Joey: We don&#146;t make enough fun of you already?</p>

<p>Ross: Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.</p>

<p>Chandler: You do know that Wham broke up?</p>

<p>Ross: I like it, and Emily likes it, and that&#146;s what counts. So uh, how are
you guys doing?</p>

<p>Joey: Oh-no, don&#146;t try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.</p>

<p>Chandler: Where is Emily?</p>

<p>Ross: Ugh, she&#146;s saying good-bye to her uncle.</p>

<p>Chandler: Man, didn&#146;t she like just get here?</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah!! Yeah!</p>

<p>Chandler: Easy tiger.</p>

<p>Ross: I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the
airport, it&#146;s-it&#146;s so great. But at the same time I&#146;m thinking, &quot;Well,
I&#146;m gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off.&quot;</p>

<p>Chandler: So what are you going to do?</p>

<p>Ross: Nothing! There&#146;s nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here.
I mean, she-she&#146;d have to uh, move here. She should move here!</p>

<p>Joey: What?</p>

<p>Ross: I could ask her to live with me!</p>

<p>Chandler: Are you serious?</p>

<p>Ross: I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!</p>

<p>Chandler: Because you&#146;ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, I&#146;ve got
a carton of milk in my fridge I&#146;ve had a longer relationship with!</p>

<p>Ross: Look guys, when I&#146;m with her it&#146;s-it&#146;s-it&#146;s like she
brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y&#146;know?</p>

<p>Chandler: And I love the milk! But, I&#146;m not gonna some British girl to move
in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.</p>

<p>Joey: All right look, Ross, he&#146;s right. Emily&#146;s great, she&#146;s
great! But this way too soon, you&#146;re only gonna scare her!</p>

<p>Ross: I don&#146;t want to do that.</p>

<p>Joey: No! You don&#146;t want to wreck it, you don&#146;t want to go to fast!</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, no, you&#146;re right, I know, you&#146;re right, I&#146;m not,
I&#146;m not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that same day. Joey and
Chandler are eating pizza, and Phoebe is trying to knit something.]</p>

<p>Phoebe: That&#146;s too hard. Too hard!</p>

<p>Monica: (entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!</p>

<p>Rachel: Or I&#146;ll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.</p>

<p>Chandler: No thank you.</p>

<p>Joey: Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, let&#146;s trade! The
timing&#146;s perfect, I just clogged the toilet! </p>

<p>Chandler: Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we
can&#146;t leave in the small apartment after we&#146;ve lived here! Didn&#146;t you ever
read <i>Flowers for Algernon</i>?</p>

<p>Joey: Yes! Didn&#146;t you ever read <i>Sports Illustrated</i>?! No! I
didn&#146;t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!</p>

<p>Chandler: Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot
more than just season seats.</p>

<p>Joey: It&#146;s the Knicks!</p>

<p>Chandler: Screw the Knicks!</p>

<p>Joey: Whoa!</p>

<p>Chandler: I didn&#146;t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so
much more.</p>

<p>Joey: Huh.</p>

<p>Chandler: And the Knicks rule all.</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, the Knicks rule all!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?</p>

<p>Chandler: No. No. We&#146;re not gonna do that, y&#146;know why? Because its not
an even trade.</p>

<p>Rachel: All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the
tickets?</p>

<p>Joey: Done!</p>

<p>Rachel: Let me finish. </p>

<p>Joey: Oh. </p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m talking about a bet, winner takes all.</p>

<p>Joey: Ooh, we could end up with nothing.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Or you could end up with everything.</p>

<p>Joey: Ooh, I like that.</p>

<p>Monica: All right, so what do you say?</p>

<p>Chandler: No!</p>

<p>Monica: Oh, just do it!!</p>

<p>Chandler: Op, op, I&#146;m convinced!</p>

<p>Joey: Come on man, you know I&#146;d do it for you! Because, you&#146;re my best
friend.</p>

<p>Chandler: All right, but you can&#146;t use that again for a whole year.
I&#146;m in.</p>

<p>Joey: All right!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she&#146;s
the only who&#146;s impartial, and she&#146;s so pretty.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh&#151;oh, I have a game!</p>

<p>Joey: Okay! </p>

<p>Chandler: Okay!</p>

<p>Phoebe: This is great!</p>

<p>Joey: What&#146;s the game?! What&#146;s the game?!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh, well, it doesn&#146;t have a name&#151;oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it
doesn&#146;t have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?</p>

<p>Monica: They&#146;re green?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Good! Good! Five points!</p>

<p>(They both rejoice; Chandler is totally confused.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: All right, Joey, same question.</p>

<p>(He looks to Chandler, who doesn&#146;t have a clue.)</p>

<p>Joey: Uhh, they&#146;re tall.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy,
leafy.</p>

<p>(Joey turns and is angry that Chandler didn&#146;t come up with the answer.)</p>

<p>Monica: That&#146;s not even a game!</p>

<p>Rachel: What? Shut up! We&#146;re winning!</p>

<p>Monica: You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high
card wins. What do you say?</p>

<p>Chandler: Fine, let&#146;s do it.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh, I have cards!</p>

<p>Joey: Oh.</p>

<p>Monica: Oh, good.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the
trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay.</p>

<p>Monica: Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.</p>

<p>Chandler: That&#146;s a low one!</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I can&#146;t.</p>

<p>Phoebe: What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.)</p>

<p>Joey: Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!</p>

<p>(Both Joey and Chandler and Monica and Rachel jump up and down for joy.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Why are you screaming and hugging?</p>

<p>Monica: Because we won our apartment back!</p>

<p>Joey: What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!</p>

<p>Monica: No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!</p>

<p>(They all look to Phoebe to settle this.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: I don&#146;t know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.)
Ah-ha!</p>

<p>Rachel: All right, cut, let&#146;s pick again, pick again.</p>

<p>Joey: Okay.</p>

<p>Rachel: Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen
is high!</p>

<p>Joey: Uh-huh, not as high as&#133;(picks a card) It worked! King!</p>

<p>Chandler: Yeah baby!</p>

<p>Monica: But, we pick again! We pick again!</p>

<p>Joey: Why?!</p>

<p>Monica: I don&#146;t know!</p>

<p>Chandler: Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) That&#146;s courtside
baby!</p>

<p>Joey: Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them,
but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment
back!</p>

<p>Chandler: No they didn&#146;t!</p>

<p>[Scene: Ross&#146;s apartment, Emily has packed as Ross returns.]</p>

<p>Ross: Hey!</p>

<p>Emily: I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.</p>

<p>Ross: (laughs) Move in with me.</p>

<p>Emily: What?!</p>

<p>Ross: Don&#146;t be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say
it&#146;s too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.</p>

<p>Emily: Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.</p>

<p>Ross: I know.</p>

<p>Emily: My job!</p>

<p>Ross: Well, so, you-you&#146;ll get a job here! I mean, I&#146;m always hearing
about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!</p>

<p>Emily: Yeah, but it-it-it&#146;s my whole life&#151;you come to England.</p>

<p>Ross: No, I can&#146;t. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I
can&#146;t leave him. Isn&#146;t&#151;you don&#146;t think there&#146;s any way?</p>

<p>Emily: Ohh, I don&#146;t think so. I mean it would be different if it was way
into the future &#150;and-and-and we were getting married or something.</p>

<p>Ross: What?</p>

<p>Emily: Oh no, no, right I shouldn&#146;t have said married. Uh, please
don&#146;t go freaky on me. I didn&#146;t mean it. Well, I didn&#146;t say it; I take it
back!</p>

<p>Ross: No, no, don&#146;t. Why don&#146;t we?</p>

<p>Emily: Why don&#146;t we what?</p>

<p>Ross: Get married.</p>

<p>Emily: You are mad!</p>

<p>Ross: No! No! I&#146;m not! It&#146;s-it&#146;s-it&#146;s perfect! I mean
it&#146;s better than you just-just moving here, &#145;cause it&#146;s us together
forever, and that&#146;s-that&#146;s what I want.</p>

<p>Emily: We&#146;ve only known each other for six weeks!</p>

<p>Ross: Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who&#146;s-who&#146;s to say? Does that me
we-we can&#146;t do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married
and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us.
Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I
mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn&#146;t it?</p>

<p>Emily: My parents are going to be really mad.</p>

<p>Ross: Is that&#151;are you saying yes? Is that yes?</p>

<p>Emily: Yes.</p>

<p>(They kiss and hug.)</p>

<p>Emily: Yes!</p>

<p>Ross: Yes! We&#146;re getting married?!</p>

<p>Emily: Oh my God! </p>

<p>Ross: Yes!</p>

<p>Emily: We&#146;re getting married!</p>

<p>Ross: Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you
marry me?</p>

<p>Emily: Yes.</p>

<p>(He tries to put it on her finger.)</p>

<p>Emily: Ohh, it&#146;s a bit small.</p>

<p>Ross: Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!</p>

<p>Emily: It was.</p>

<p>(They kiss.)</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commerical Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: The hallway, Joey and Chandler are coming back from the game.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Those were like the best seats ever.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y&#146;know, kinda
like a peace offering.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh yeah, that&#146;s very nice. Plus, y&#146;know they were free and
they&#146;re too small.</p>

<p>(He knocks on the girls&#146; door and walks in. Surprise! The girls, obviously using <i>Star
Trek</i> technology, have completely moved everything in both apartments back to their
original positions, all in the time it took for the guys to go to a basketball game. Wow!
Anyhoo, Chandler is stunned, and Joey doesn&#146;t even realise it.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head
cut off.)</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.)
(Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!</p>

<p>Chandler: I KNOW!!!</p>

<p>(They both sprint to what used to be their apartment.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Open up! Open up! Open up!</p>

<p>(A very angry Monica opens the door with the security chain still on.)</p>

<p>Monica: We&#146;ll discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)</p>

<p>Chandler: What the hell is going on?!</p>

<p>(It&#146;s Rachel&#146;s turn to open the door.)</p>

<p>Rachel: We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.)
(Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I don&#146;t feel good about it.</p>

<p>(She goes to close the door, but Chandler puts his foot it in.)</p>

<p>Chandler: We are switching back, right now!</p>

<p>Monica: No, we&#146;re not! We&#146;re not leaving!</p>

<p>Chandler: Well, you&#146;re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have
jobs, and as soon as you do, we&#146;re switching it back! There&#146;s nothing you can do
to stop us! Right, Joe?</p>

<p>Joey: I don&#146;t know.</p>

<p>Chandler: What?</p>

<p>Joey: I don&#146;t want to move again! </p>

<p>Chandler: I don&#146;t care, this is our apartment! And they stole&#151;you
stole it&#151;our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am
getting it back right now. I&#146;m getting back right now!</p>

<p>(They open the door.)</p>

<p>Rachel: All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup
offer.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can&#146;t offer anything to us!</p>

<p>Rachel: Let us keep the apartment and&#133;</p>

<p>Monica: As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.</p>

<p>[Time lapse. The guys are entering their apartment.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Totally worth it!</p>

<p>Joey: That was one good minute!</p>

<p>Chandler: Good night.</p>

<p>Joey: Good night.</p>

<p>(They both go back into their old rooms and shut the doors. Of course, Chandler has to
close both sections of his door.)</p>

<p>[Cut to the girls apartment.]</p>

<p>Monica: Men are such idiots.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our
apartment back?</p>

<p>Phoebe: That&#146;s so funny to think if you&#146;d just done that right after
the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.</p>

<p>Monica: Yeah, let-let-let&#146;s pretend that&#146;s not true.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay, scarf&#146;s done. (It&#146;s not really a scarf, it&#146;s just a
bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with
them Joey and Chandler.)</p>

<p>Ross: Come on! Come on. Come on.</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey!</p>

<p>Ross: Hey!</p>

<p>Monica: What-what&#146;s going on?</p>

<p>Joey: Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.</p>

<p>Ross: Uhh, okay, it&#146;s uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.</p>

<p>(The gang is stunned.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!</p>

<p>Emily: Umm, no.</p>

<p>Monica: When, when did&#151;how, how did you&#133;</p>

<p>Ross: We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.</p>

<p>Emily: I mean, we know it&#146;s a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right,
so&#133;</p>

<p>(Rachel slowly walks in from her bedroom. She is stunned speechless.)</p>

<p>Ross: (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for
Rachel&#146;s reaction.) I think it&#146;s great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, I&#146;m so happy for
you!</p>

<p>(Seeing Rachel&#146;s apparently okay with this, the rest of the gang jumps up to
congratulate Ross and Emily on their pending nuptials.) </p>

<p>Chandler: Oh, well, that&#146;s great!</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah! Yeah!</p>

<p>Monica: (to Ross) I can&#146;t believe you&#146;re getting married! </p>

<p>Ross: Yeah. (They hug again.)</p>

<p>Joey: Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at
him.)</p>
