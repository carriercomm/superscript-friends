<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Monica, and Rachel are sitting on the couch and Ross is
sitting on the chair, and they&#146;re all talking.] </p>

<p>Rachel: Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?</p>

<p>Joey: Probably Monica and Chandler.</p>

<p>(A woman walks up to Gunther in the background.)</p>

<p><strong>Woman:</strong> (to Gunther) Hi. Could I have a pack of <i>Newport Lights</i>,
please?</p>

<p>Gunther: Oh umm, uh we don&#146;t sell cigarettes, but they have them at the
newsstand across the street. (Points.)</p>

<p><strong>Woman:</strong> That&#146;d be great, thanks. (Gunther goes and gets them.)</p>

<p>Rachel: (to the gang) Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don&#146;t think I have
the energy for this.</p>

<p>Melissa: (Gasps when she notices Rachel) Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?! (Screams)</p>

<p>Rachel: (screaming) Melissa!</p>

<p>Melissa: You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters,
what&#146;s up with you?!</p>

<p>Rachel: Wh&#151;(Turns and looks at the gang who&#146;s staring)&#151;Why
don&#146;t I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.)</p>

<p>Melissa: So last I heard you were gonna get married. (Grabs Rachel&#146;s hand
and notices that she doesn&#146;t have a ring on it.) (Sadly) Oh poor Ray-ray.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh no-no, no! It&#146;s good! It&#146;s all good! I-I actually work at <i>Ralph
Lauren</i>!</p>

<p>Melissa: Shut up!</p>

<p>Rachel: I will not! I&#146;m the divisional head of men&#146;s sportswear!</p>

<p>Melissa: Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh please&#133;</p>

<p>Melissa: (excitedly) Are you?!</p>

<p>Rachel: No.</p>

<p>Melissa: Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow
night?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh tomorrow, oh I don&#146;t know. Um&#133;</p>

<p>Melissa: You do now. You&#146;re having dinner with me.</p>

<p>Rachel: Shut up.</p>

<p>Melissa: I-I&#146;ve got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! (Gunther returns
with her cigarettes.) Oh, there you are. (Takes them from Gunther.) (To Rachel) Umm, so
listen, just call me. Here&#146;s my card. (Hands the card over.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh you&#146;re in real estate!</p>

<p>Melissa: Oh no, that&#146;s-that&#146;s an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of
that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.</p>

<p>Rachel: Wow! What do you do now?</p>

<p>Melissa: (quietly) I&#146;m a party planner. I&#146;ll see you tomorrow.
(Exits.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.)</p>

<p>Joey: Hey guys! Look who&#146;s back! It&#146;s Ray-ray!</p>

<p>Rachel: Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.</p>

<p>Ross: She seems really, really fun!</p>

<p>Rachel: She&#146;s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.</p>

<p>Monica: Wait a minute, she isn&#146;t&#133; She&#146;s not the one who you&#133;</p>

<p>Joey: (excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!</p>

<p>Rachel: (To Monica) Yes.</p>

<p>Monica: Wow!</p>

<p>Joey: (excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you&#151;what?!!</p>

<p>Rachel: It&#146;s not a big deal!</p>

<p>Monica: (To Joey) They were lovers.</p>

<p>Ross: What?!</p>

<p>Joey: What?!</p>

<p>Rachel: No we weren&#146;t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we
went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y&#146;know, ended up&#133;kissing for a
bit.</p>

<p>Ross: So that&#146;s two of my wives.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Opening Credits</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is working on the seating chart while Chandler
looks on and Rachel reads.]</p>

<p>Monica: (telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay so this is where the
band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have
people&#146;s names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And
Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachel&#146;s place.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh wow. Why don&#146;t we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a
Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs.
Monica just glares at her.) These pins aren&#146;t for playing are they?</p>

<p>Monica: (To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are
yours.</p>

<p>Chandler: This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.</p>

<p>Monica: Chandler, relax it&#146;s not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not a
close one.</p>

<p>Joey: (entering) Hello!</p>

<p>Rachel: Hey!</p>

<p>Joey: Hey Rach. (Stares at her.) </p>

<p>Rachel: Stop picturing it!!</p>

<p>Monica: Okay, I think that&#146;s it. The seating chart is done. This is our
wedding. They all look like they&#146;re having fun don&#146;t they?</p>

<p>Joey: Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?</p>

<p>Monica: Oh! (Gets up) Let&#146;s see, well&#133;if this is the wedding hall then
umm (Walks away) you&#146;re parents will be at home in Queens.</p>

<p>Joey: What they&#146;re not invited?! Oh no, that&#146;s terrible! They&#146;re
gonna be crushed!</p>

<p>Monica: Why would they think they&#146;re invited?</p>

<p>Joey: (looking around) You got me. I don&#146;t&#133;</p>

<p>Monica: Joey!</p>

<p>Joey: Well, I&#146;m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y&#146;know? Your
parents are comin&#146;! Chandler&#146;s parents are comin&#146;! Ross&#146;s parents are
comin&#146;!</p>

<p>Monica: Ross&#146;s parents are my parents!</p>

<p>Joey: Well-well&#151;see? Parents are comin&#146;!</p>

<p>Chandler: Y&#146;know I think we should invite them.</p>

<p>Monica: Oh please, you just want more blue pins.</p>

<p>Chandler: Well this is just sad!</p>

<p>Monica: All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some
rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!</p>

<p>Rachel: That is not a problem.</p>

<p>Joey: (leaning down to her) Maybe you&#146;ll order a little sangria?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)</p>

<p>[Scene: <i>Ralph Lauren</i>, Rachel is showing Chandler the selection of tuxedos.]</p>

<p>Rachel: (motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and
if there&#146;s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a
few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.</p>

<p>Chandler: Well, thanks a lot for hookin&#146; me up Rach. I want you to know
that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m Monica&#146;s maid of honor. Okay? Don&#146;t try to blue pin
me!</p>

<p>Chandler: (sees another rack) Well, what&#146;s the deal with these? These-these
look nice.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then
when they&#146;re done with them they just send &#145;em back.</p>

<p>Chandler: You mean like for award shows?</p>

<p>Rachel: Some of them.</p>

<p>Chandler: You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people
yelling, &quot;You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!&quot;</p>

<p>Rachel: Honey, might I suggest watching a little more <i>ESPN </i>and a little
less <i>E!</i>?</p>

<p>Chandler: Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Umm, well let&#146;s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.</p>

<p>Chandler: Not bad.</p>

<p>Rachel: (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O&#146;Neil.</p>

<p>Chandler: Who&#146;s that?</p>

<p>Rachel: He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, <i>ESPN</i>! Just once and a while,
have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one
was Pierce Brosnan!</p>

<p>Chandler: Pierce Brosnan?</p>

<p>Rachel: Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Chandler: Are you serious?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chandler: 007?! This is James Bond&#146;s tux?!</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh, I have to get married in James Bond&#146;s tux!</p>

<p>Rachel: It&#146;s a pretty cool tux.</p>

<p>Chandler: Oh, it&#146;s not just that, I would be England&#146;s most powerful
weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty&#146;s secret service. A man who fears no
one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?</p>

<p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Phoebe are moving chess pieces around on the board
and hitting the timer at random.]</p>

<p>Joey: We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey&#146;s like
in Checkers.) Chess!</p>

<p>Joey: Nice move.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah.</p>

<p>Rachel: (entering) Hey!</p>

<p>Joey: Hey!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey!</p>

<p>Rachel: So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the
wedding, do you need one?</p>

<p>Joey: No, I&#146;m performing the ceremony. I&#146;m not wearing a tux.</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, what are you going to wear?</p>

<p>Joey: Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.</p>

<p>Rachel: Huh. Does Monica know about this?</p>

<p>Joey: I don&#146;t think so.</p>

<p>Rachel: Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)</p>

<p>Phoebe: Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh, y&#146;know what? I can&#146;t. I have to have dinner with that
Melissa girl.</p>

<p>Joey: (excitedly) Can I come?! I won&#146;t even talk! You&#146;ll just hear the
noise from my video camera.</p>

<p>Phoebe: What is this? What&#146;s going on?</p>

<p>Joey: Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!</p>

<p>Rachel: Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey&#146;s lewd
version?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Joey&#146;s!</p>

<p>Joey: Okay&#133;</p>

<p>Rachel: Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid
mistake of telling Joey that one time&#133;she and I y&#146;know&#133;kissed a little bit.</p>

<p>Phoebe: (laughs) Yeah, I&#146;m sure that happened.</p>

<p>Rachel: It-it did!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Sure!</p>

<p>Joey: Hey. (Laughs then seriously) It happened!</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and
Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes! </p>

<p>Phoebe: (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the
cheek.</p>

<p>Joey: Why are you taking this away from me?</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay! I just&#151;I didn&#146;t know that you are a lesbian. (Joey
smiles and nods lewdly.)</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m not saying that I&#146;m a lesbian! I&#146;m just saying that
this happened!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you&#146;re so&#151;y&#146;know
so&#133;vanilla.</p>

<p>Rachel: (shocked) Vanilla?!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah.</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m not vanilla! I&#146;ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I
got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!</p>

<p>Phoebe: To Ross.</p>

<p>Rachel: All right, y&#146;know what? If you don&#146;t want to believe me about
this, why don&#146;t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Okay! All right! Yeah! &#145;Cause I just can&#146;t picture it.</p>

<p>Joey: Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.</p>

<p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is on the couch reading as Ross enters carrying a
garment bag.]</p>

<p>Ross: Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)</p>

<p>Chandler: A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?</p>

<p>Ross: No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman&#146;s
tux!</p>

<p>Chandler: What?</p>

<p>Ross: That&#146;s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the
hit film&#133;that Batman film he was in.</p>

<p>Chandler: You can&#146;t wear that! I&#146;m wearing the famous tux! James
Bond&#146;s tux!</p>

<p>Ross: So?</p>

<p>Chandler: So&#151;If you wear that you&#146;ll make mine less special.</p>

<p>Ross: Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have
the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.</p>

<p>(Chandler mimics him.)</p>

<p>Chandler: Please, don&#146;t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!</p>

<p>Ross: Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.</p>

<p>Chandler: Look, it&#146;s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I
would never do anything to upset you.</p>

<p>Ross: When I got married you slept with my sister.</p>

<p>Chandler: That was pretty 007.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is still working on the seating chart as Joey
enters.]</p>

<p>Joey: Hey.</p>

<p>Monica: Hey. Oh good-good you&#146;re here! All right, I figured it out.
I&#146;m gonna take two tables of eight, I&#146;m gonna add your parents, and I&#146;m
gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two
extra meals, we are good to go!</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah, they&#146;re not coming.</p>

<p>Monica: (looking at him) What?!</p>

<p>Joey: Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.
They&#133;feel a little unwanted.</p>

<p>Monica: Oh that&#146;s too bad. It&#146;s true, but too bad.</p>

<p>Joey: Look Mon, if you could just call my mom&#133;</p>

<p>Monica: Oh Joey!</p>

<p>Joey: Come on! Look just-just tell&#151;let her know that you really want them
to be there. Let&#146;s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over
the years.</p>

<p>Monica: No she hasn&#146;t.</p>

<p>Joey: Is it her fault that some of them didn&#146;t make it to you?</p>

<p>Monica: Well, what am I going to say?</p>

<p>Joey: I don&#146;t know. Just uh, just tell &#145;em it was a mix-up with the
invitations, or&#151;No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post
office. And the Irish! But I don&#146;t think you can blame it on them so&#133; (He dials
the phone and hands it to Monica.)</p>

<p>Monica: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this
is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah I&#146;m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh,
really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that
we sent weren&#146;t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post
office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the
US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What are they Irish?! (Joey gives
her a thumbs up.)</p>

<p>[Scene: A restaurant, Melissa, Rachel, and Phoebe are talking.]</p>

<p>Melissa: &#133;anyway, his name is Allan and we&#146;ve been going out for three
years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for
his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. (Rachel and Phoebe politely laugh) And he was Theta
Beta Pi at Syracuse.</p>

<p>Rachel: Oh. Oh, that&#146;s great!</p>

<p>Melissa: Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.</p>

<p>Melissa: What one?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Yeah! Y&#146;know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us
down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.</p>

<p>Melissa: Oh, isn&#146;t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
(Phoebe agrees by grunting.)</p>

<p>Rachel: (changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh,
tellin&#146; Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I
uh, we made out.</p>

<p>Melissa: (shocked) What?</p>

<p>Rachel: Remember?! We&#151;come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the
coconut bikini tops&#133;</p>

<p>Melissa: Yeah?</p>

<p>Rachel: &#133;we went back the house and we got really silly and we&#133;we made
out.</p>

<p>Melissa: Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you&#146;re talking about.</p>

<p>Phoebe: Really?!</p>

<p align="center"><strong>Commercial Break</strong></p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is on the couch as Chandler disgustedly enters.]</p>

<p>Chandler: Ross is Batman!</p>

<p>Monica: Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.</p>

<p>Chandler: Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman
is so much cooler than James Bond!</p>

<p>Monica: What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!</p>

<p>Chandler: Batman has a utility belt!</p>

<p>Monica: 007 has a fancy car!</p>

<p>Chandler: Batman has the Batmobile!</p>

<p>Monica: 007 gets all the ladies.</p>

<p>Chandler: Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get <i>ESPN</i> right?</p>

<p>Monica: How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I&#146;ll make you a nice
martini.</p>

<p>Chandler: Actually, I don&#146;t like martinis.</p>

<p>Monica: How about a <i>Youhoo</i> with a funny straw?</p>

<p>Chandler: Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)</p>

<p>Joey: (entering) Hey.</p>

<p>Monica: Hey.</p>

<p>Joey: Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want
people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?</p>

<p>Monica: The show?!</p>

<p>Joey: Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it&#146;s gonna start a
little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?</p>

<p>Monica: Have you ever been to one of my weddings?</p>

<p>Joey: Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it&#146;s the same day as my
niece&#146;s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me.
&#145;Cause my part&#146;s just in the beginning I&#146;m not even in the rest of the
show&#151;Wedding!</p>

<p>Monica: The wedding starts at six.</p>

<p>Joey: Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little
&#145;til they get there?</p>

<p>Monica: You&#146;ll vamp?!</p>

<p>Joey: Yeah! Yeah y&#146;know, like warm up the crowd. Ask &#145;em where
they&#146;re from. &#145;Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an
entertainer. I&#146;m a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no one better! There is no one
greater!</p>

<p>[Scene: The restaurant, continued from earlier.]</p>

<p>Rachel: How can you not remember us kissing?!</p>

<p>Melissa: I don&#146;t know. I don&#146;t remember a lot of things that never
happened.</p>

<p>Rachel: Wh&#133; Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We
couldn&#146;t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin&#146; together?</p>

<p>Phoebe: Oh, somewhere Joey&#146;s head is exploding.</p>

<p>Rachel: Yeah&#151;but come on&#151;Listen, I&#146;m sorry I don&#146;t want to
make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn&#146;t believe
me.</p>

<p>Melissa: I&#146;m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it.
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.</p>

<p>Rachel: No!!</p>

<p>Phoebe: Rachel, it&#146;s okay. You don&#146;t have to do this. I believe you.
All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.</p>

<p>Rachel: Thank you Phoebe.</p>

<p>Melissa: She didn&#146;t.</p>

<p>Phoebe: I know.</p>

<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are working on the seating chart as
Ross enters carrying his tux around.]</p>

<p>Ross: Hey!</p>

<p>Monica: You just carry that around?</p>

<p>Ross: Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece. </p>

<p>Monica: Between you and&#133;</p>

<p>Ross: Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don&#146;t we put them on? Y&#146;know
get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.</p>

<p>Chandler: I would but mine doesn&#146;t fit. The pants are a little tight.</p>

<p>Monica: A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.</p>

<p>Ross: Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes
together.</p>

<p>Chandler: Well, does that mean that you&#146;re not going to wearing yours?</p>

<p>Ross: What are you kidding? It&#146;s Batman&#146;s tux!!</p>

<p>Chandler: (standing up) Let me try it on!</p>

<p>Ross: Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin&#146; in
there.</p>

<p>Chandler: (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds
something in the pocket) What&#146;s this?</p>

<p>Ross: What?</p>

<p>Chandler: An invitation for the <i>At First Sight</i> premiere? Oh my God! Val
Kilmer didn&#146;t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity
love story where he played a blind guy!</p>

<p>Ross: Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!</p>

<p>Chandler: The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
(Hands him the jacket and walks away.)</p>

<p>Joey: (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?</p>

<p>Monica: All right that&#146;s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it!
You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and
scream racial slurs? I don&#146;t care!</p>

<p>Joey: No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents,
that was really sweet. They&#146;re so happy they get to be a part of your special day.</p>

<p>Monica: (defeated) Oh.</p>

<p>Chandler: Well, you&#146;re welcome. And tell them we&#146;re really glad
they&#146;re coming.</p>

<p>Joey: Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!
(Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this
when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party
time.</p>

<p>[Scene: Outside the restaurant, Melissa, Phoebe, and Rachel are emerging.]</p>

<p>Rachel: It happened! I am telling you it happened!</p>

<p>Melissa: Okay. (To Phoebe) Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I
don&#146;t think I&#146;ll be calling you (hails a cab) because umm, y&#146;know
you&#146;ve gotten weird. (The cab pulls up.) Take care you guys.</p>

<p>(She&#146;s about to get in when&#133;)</p>

<p>Rachel: What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look, that
night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I&#146;m not
gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don&#146;t remember that, maybe
you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)</p>

<p>Melissa: My God! You love me!</p>

<p>Rachel: (shocked) What?</p>

<p>Melissa: Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can
still hear the coconuts knockin&#146; together I&#133; (Phoebe is shocked.) I just
didn&#146;t want to tell you &#145;cause I didn&#146;t think that you&#146;d return my
love, and now that you have&#133; (Leans in to kiss Rachel.)</p>

<p>Rachel: (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!</p>

<p>Melissa: Aww, look who&#146;s being suddenly shy. You can&#146;t tell me you
don&#146;t feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. (Goes in again.)</p>

<p>Rachel: (moves away again) I-I-I-I&#146;m just&#133;I&#146;m just a good kisser!</p>

<p>Melissa: (suddenly frightened) Shut up!</p>

<p>Rachel: I&#146;m sorry!</p>

<p>Melissa: (laughs) Oh you don&#146;t have to be (Laughs again) sorry.
I&#146;m&#133;I&#146;m obviously kidding. I&#146;m not in love with you. (To Phoebe)
I&#146;m not in love with her. I don&#146;t hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I
don&#146;t&#133;picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go.
Eh&#133;kiss good-bye? (Rachel stares at her stunned.) No? Okay. (Hurries into the cab and
drives off.)</p>

<p>Rachel: Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna&#133;</p>

<p>(Suddenly, Phoebe leans in and kisses her on the lips!)</p>

<p>Rachel: What the hell was that?!</p>

<p>Phoebe: I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.</p>

<p>Rachel: And?</p>

<p>Phoebe: I&#146;ve had better.</p>
