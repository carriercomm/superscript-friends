That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!"},{"trigger":"Y'know?","reply":"Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff."},{"trigger":"Huh.","reply":"I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?"},{"trigger":"Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really do not wanna see or talk to her.","reply":"Well, there you go!"},{"trigger":"Maybe today is just, close call day.","reply":"Close call day."},{"trigger":"Hey, thanks Rach.","reply":"Ohh, honey no problem.

That'll be $2,000."},{"trigger":"What?!","reply":"Okay, a thousand."},{"trigger":"I thought you wanted to adopt your cat.","reply":"Well, I do, but you are just gonna have to actually look at this as more of an investment than a cat."},{"trigger":"Okay, yeah, I just wanted a cat.","reply":"Okay, did anybody just hear that? Anybody?"},{"trigger":"What is your cat doing in one of my bowls!","reply":"It is not! I am defrosting a chicken. Oh, I uh sold Mrs. Whiskerson."},{"trigger":"Did you get your money back?","reply":"Yeah, 15 hundred dollars."},{"trigger":"I just came for the red-velvet pillow.","reply":"Oh yeah, there you go."},{"trigger":"And-and do not forget you-you can come visit her anytime you want.","reply":"Oh good, great!

Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that is not true."},{"trigger":"That is not true?","reply":"No."},{"trigger":"Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.","reply":"Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him."},{"trigger":"You are sadly mistaken.","reply":"I-I do not want your job. I-I do not. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I do not even know how to use my keycard."},{"trigger":"It is the way you said it.Oh My God, I am a women!!!","reply":"Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job."},{"trigger":"But why didn't you just tell her the truth.","reply":"I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren."},{"trigger":"Huh, did she ever think of that?","reply":"You were with Kenny today, weren't you?"},{"trigger":"Just for a second.","reply":"Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?"},{"trigger":"Sleep with Ralph Lauren.","reply":"I am not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren.

It is got all of these layers. First there is a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!"},{"trigger":"W-What was the one right before bananas?","reply":"The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought \"well, there is mincemeat pie,\" I mean that is an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?"},{"trigger":"Y-sure!","reply":"And while I am gone do not you boys sneak a taste."},{"trigger":"Vomiting stories are funny.","reply":"Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!"},{"trigger":"Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?","reply":"No!"},{"trigger":"Rachel?","reply":"Yeah?"},{"trigger":"And that they're going to be drinking alot!?","reply":"No, I did, but tell me again, because it is so romantic."},{"trigger":"Can't you do it any faster?","reply":"Joey!

Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it is probably really hard for you to be alone right now."},{"trigger":"You're alone.","reply":"No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you are alone, alone. And I just-it is just not the time for us. I am sorry."},{"trigger":"Come on, let is serve that dessert already!","reply":"Joey, you are gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You do not get any dessert."},{"trigger":"Really?","reply":"No, I am just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it is trifle time!"},{"trigger":"So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?","reply":"It sure is."},{"trigger":"So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?","reply":"Beef."},{"trigger":"Ohhh no.","reply":"Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste."},{"trigger":"Really?","reply":"Oh oh oh, wait!

How good?"},{"trigger":"I am gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.","reply":"Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it."},{"trigger":"Gooooood.","reply":".So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?"},{"trigger":"Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.","reply":"Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?"},{"trigger":"And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.","reply":"Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!"},{"trigger":"I love Jacques Cousteau!","reply":"I was not supposed to put beef in the trifle!"},{"trigger":"I'll talk to them!","reply":"You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I would not feel bad!"},{"trigger":"I remember when people used to use big lights.","reply":"That is a good story, Grandpa."},{"trigger":"And that was like 4000 years ago.","reply":"So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story."},{"trigger":"What, what are you laughing at?","reply":"Well, I used to date him, but you are still going out with her!"},{"trigger":"She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!","reply":"Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I am sorry, but I do not think that was a romantic thing."},{"trigger":"But if she says 'Dude, what the hell are you doing?' I can say 'It was not me, it was New Years!'","reply":"Well, that is a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick."},{"trigger":"So when is it gonna air?","reply":"Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet."},{"trigger":"This doesn't concern you.","reply":"We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica."},{"trigger":"She is always best at us that wily minx.","reply":"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, them we're gonna go over to Joey is and search, OK?"},{"trigger":"Why?","reply":"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?"},{"trigger":"A great idea!","reply":"Chandler, that is not enough.

You bitch!"},{"trigger":"Who did you leave a message with?","reply":"Joey, Joey I am so sorry."},{"trigger":"Rach, how would you feel if say, I wanted to move you mom, and you said do not, and I did it anyway and her head fell off?","reply":"Okay, come onJoey, I'll buy you a new one!

I can not even begin to explain to you how much I am gonna miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go. Okay, so if you think that I didn't say goodbye to you because you do not mean as much to me as everybody else, you are wrong. It is because you mean more to me. So there, all right, there is your goodbye. Oh!"},{"trigger":"Rach!","reply":"What?"},{"trigger":"You can not.","reply":"WHAT?"}]
